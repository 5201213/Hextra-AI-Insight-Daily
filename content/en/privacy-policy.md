### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes spelled out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to meet our legal duties (like if we gotta keep your data to follow applicable laws), settle disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hold onto Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter time, unless it's used to amp up the security of our Service or make its features better, or if we're legally obligated to keep this data for longer.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might get shuffled to — and kept on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other government jurisdiction where the data protection laws might be different from yours.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're cool with that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. No transfer of your Personal Data will happen to an organization or a country unless there are solid controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal info.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask us to help delete the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you zap certain info about you right from inside the Service.

You can update, tweak, or delete your info anytime by logging into your Account (if you've got one) and heading to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. You can also hit us up to ask for access to, correction of, or deletion of any personal info you've given us.

Just a heads-up, though: we might need to keep certain info when we have a legal obligation or a legitimate basis to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get moved. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
Under certain circumstances, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if it's required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might drop your Personal Data, figuring in good faith that such action is necessary to:
-   Play by the legal rules
-   Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
-   Guard against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
Keeping your Personal Data safe is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% foolproof. While we do our best to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kid has given us Personal Data, please hit us up. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to ditch that info from our servers.

If we need to lean on consent as a legal basis for processing your info and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get sent straight to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We've got no control over, and don't take any responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to check this Privacy Policy regularly for any tweaks. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.
