# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy lays out our game plan for how we collect, use, and spill the beans (or not!) about your info when you use our Service. It also fills you in on your privacy rights and how the law's got your back.

We actually put your personal data to good use – it helps us provide and supercharge our Service. By hopping on board and using our Service, you're basically giving us the thumbs-up to collect and use your info just as this Privacy Policy describes.

## Explanations & Definitions

### Let's Get Specific
Heads up! Capitalized terms in this policy have super specific meanings, defined right here. And just to keep things crystal clear, these definitions rock the same meaning whether they pop up in singular or plural.

### Definitions (The Nitty-Gritty!)
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:

- **Account** means a unique account crafted just for you to get into our Service or parts of it.

- **Affiliate** means an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party. And just so we're on the same page, "control" here means owning 50% or more of the shares, equity interest, or other securities that have voting power to elect directors or other managing authority. Talk about having a say!

- **Company** (a.k.a. "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this Agreement) refers to **[He Xi 2077's AI Daily](https://ai.hubtoday.app/)**.

- **Cookies** are just small files dropped onto your computer, mobile device, or any other gadget by a website. They hold bits of info like your browsing history on that site, serving up a bunch of different purposes.

- **Country** means: California, USA.

- **Device** means any gadget that can access our Service – think computer, cell phone, or a digital tablet.

- **Personal Data** is any info relating to an identified or identifiable individual. Pretty straightforward, right?

- **Service** refers to the Website. Simple as that.

- **Service Provider** means any natural or legal person who crunches data on behalf of the Company. These are typically third-party companies or individuals hired by the Company to help us deliver the Service, perform Service-related duties, or help us analyze how the Service is being used. They're our trusty sidekicks!

- **Usage Data** means data that's automatically collected, generated either by using the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (like how long you're chilling on a page).

- **Website** refers to **[He Xi 2077's AI Daily](https://ai.hubtoday.app/)**, which you can find right here: `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You** means the individual hitting up or using our Service, or the company or other legal entity on behalf of whom such individual is accessing or using the Service. That's you!

## Collecting & Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data (The "Who Are You?" Stuff)
When you're diving into our Service, we might ask you for some personal identifying information – the kind of stuff that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This 'Personal Data' could include, but isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data (The "How You Roll" Info)
Usage Data is the info that gets automatically scooped up whenever you use our Service. It's just how we roll!

Usage Data might include goodies like your device's Internet Protocol address (that's your IP address, for short), what browser you're using and its version, which pages on our Service you're visiting, the exact time and date of your visit, how much time you're spending on those pages, unique device identifiers, and a sprinkle of other diagnostic data.

When you hit up the Service on a mobile device, we might automatically gather certain info. This includes, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile device you're rockin', its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. You get the drill!

Oh, and when you visit our Service – whether it's on a desktop or mobile – we might also snag some info that your browser sends our way.

### Tracking Tech & Cookies (The Digital Breadcrumbs)
We're all about using Cookies and similar tracking technologies to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash away certain info. The tracking tech we use includes cool stuff like beacons, tags, and scripts. Their gig is to collect and track info, helping us level up and analyze our Service. So, what kind of tech are we talking about? It might include:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is just a tiny file that gets placed on your Device. You totally have the power to tell your browser to refuse all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But here's the catch: if you don't play ball with Cookies, you might not be able to use some parts of our Service. So, unless you've tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the cold shoulder, our Service will likely be using them.
- **Web Beacons**: Some sections of our Service and our emails might contain tiny electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company, for example, count users who've visited those pages or opened an email. They also come in handy for other website stats, like logging the popularity of a certain section and making sure our system and servers are shipshape. Pretty neat, huh?

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. When you go offline, Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device. Session Cookies, on the other hand, vanish into thin air as soon as you slam that web browser shut.

We actually use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the following reasons:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered By**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely critical for hooking you up with services available through the Website and letting you use its awesome features. They're super helpful for authenticating users and putting a stop to any dodgy use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you're asking for just wouldn't fly, and we only use these Cookies to make sure you get those services.

- **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered By**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are used to check if users have given their seal of approval for the use of Cookies on the Website. It's all about respecting your choices!

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered By**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are the brainy ones that let us remember the choices you make when you're using the Website – things like recalling your login deets or your language preferences. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience and save you from having to punch in your preferences every single time you swing by the Website. Nifty, right?

Want to know more about the Cookies we use and your options regarding them? Go ahead and check out our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy. We've got all the deets there for ya!

### How We Use Your Personal Data (The "Why We Need It" Scoop)
The Company might put your Personal Data to work for the following awesome reasons:

- **To Provide & Maintain Our Service**: This totally includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used.
- **To Manage Your Account**: This means handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you unlock different features available to registered users. Pretty cool, right?
- **For Contract Performance**: We'll use your data to develop, comply with, and deliver on the purchase contract for products, items, or services you've bought, or any other contract you've got with us through the Service.
- **To Get in Touch With You**: We might reach out via email, phone calls, SMS, or other electronic communication forms (like push notifications for a mobile app) to dish out updates or informative messages about features, products, or contracted services – including security updates – whenever it's necessary or makes sense.
- **To Hook You Up With News & Offers**: We'll send you general info about other goods, services, and events we offer that are similar to what you've already bought or asked about, unless you've opted out of getting such awesome updates.
- **To Handle Your Requests**: This means sorting out and managing all the requests you throw our way. We're here to help!
- **For Business Transfers**: We might use your info to assess or pull off a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or any other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as a going concern or as part of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, where the Personal Data we hold about our Service users is one of the assets getting transferred.
- **For Other Cool Purposes**: We might use your info for other purposes too, like crunching data, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promo campaigns are, and generally assessing and boosting our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. It's all about making things better for you!

We might also share your personal information in these scenarios:

- **With Service Providers**: We may share your personal info with Service Providers to monitor and analyze how our Service is being used, and to get in touch with you. They help us keep the lights on!
- **For Business Transfers**: During or in negotiations of any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, we might share or transfer your personal information. It's part of the biz!
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our Affiliates, and don't sweat it, we'll totally make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Our Affiliates include our parent company, any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.
- **With Business Partners**: We may share your info with our business partners to hook you up with specific products, services, or promo goodies. Sharing is caring, sometimes! 😉
- **With Other Users**: If you spill your personal info or interact with other users in public areas, that info might be seen by everyone and could even get publicly broadcast outside. So, think before you post! 🤫
- **With Your Consent**: With your A-OK, we might totally spill your personal info for any other purpose you agree to. Your word is our bond!

### Keeping Your Personal Data (For How Long?)
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's truly needed for the purposes we've laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll also keep and use your Personal Data to stick to our legal obligations (like if we gotta hold onto data to follow applicable laws), hash out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. It's all about playing by the rules!

The Company will also stash away Usage Data for internal analysis. Usually, Usage Data hangs around for a shorter period, unless that data is used to beef up our Service's security or to turbo-charge its functionality, or if we're legally obligated to keep it longer. Safety first, fun second (but still fun)!

### Transferring Your Personal Data (Going Global!)
Your info (including your super important Personal Data!) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing hang out. This means your info might get shipped over and stored on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or even governmental jurisdiction. Just a heads-up: the data protection laws in those places might be different from yours.

By giving a nod to this Privacy Policy and submitting your info, you're essentially giving us the green light for that transfer. You're in charge!

The Company is gonna take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are solid controls in place – including top-notch security for your data and other personal info. We've got your back!

### Deleting Your Personal Data (Poof! 💨)
You've totally got the right to delete your Personal Data that we've collected, or to ask us to lend a hand in getting it deleted. It's your data, after all!

Our Service might even let you wipe out certain info about yourself right from within the Service itself. How convenient is that?

You can always log into your account (if you've got one!) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. From there, you can update, tweak, or delete your deets. Or, if you prefer, just ping us! You can totally request to access, correct, or delete any personal info you've thrown our way.

But heads up: we might have to hold onto some info when we've got a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so. Some things just gotta stick around!

### Disclosing Your Personal Data (When We Spill the Beans)

#### Business Deals
If the Company gets tangled up in a merger, acquisition, or an asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. But don't you worry, we'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a whole new privacy policy.

#### Law Enforcement (When the Law Comes Knocking)
In certain situations, the Company might be asked to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or if there's a valid request from public authorities (like a court or a government agency). We gotta play by the book!

#### Other Legal Must-Dos
The Company might totally spill your Personal Data if we genuinely believe such action is needed to:
- Stick to a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
- Shield against legal liability

### The Security of Your Personal Data (Keeping It Safe...ish 🛡️)
The security of your Personal Data is a HUGE deal for us! But hey, remember this: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% foolproof. While we bust our butts to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. We're doing our best, though!

## Kiddo Privacy (Keeping the Little Ones Safe!)
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under 13 years old – period. We're not out to knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you're clued in that your kiddo has given us Personal Data, please hit us up! If we discover we've snagged Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll totally take steps to zap that info from our servers. Safety first for the little humans!

If we need to rely on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and if your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's permission before we scoop up and use that info. Always better to be safe than sorry!

## Links to Other Websites (Where We Send You Off To)
Our Service might have links pointing to other websites that we don't actually operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be zapped right over to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you go check out the Privacy Policy of every single website you visit. Better safe than sorry, always!

We don't have any control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services, and we can't take responsibility for them. Just a heads-up!

## Changes to This Privacy Policy (The "Heads Up!" Section)
We might tweak our Privacy Policy from time to time – it's just how things go! We'll totally let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before changes actually kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service. Plus, we'll make sure to update that 'Last Updated' date at the very top of this Privacy Policy. You'll be in the loop! 💡

We recommend you give this Privacy Policy a regular peek to stay in the know about any changes. The updates to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page. So, keep an eye out!
