### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes spelled out in this Privacy Policy. We'll retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to meet our legal obligations (for instance, if we're required to keep your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hold onto Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter time, unless it's used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or we're legally bound to keep this data longer.

### Where Your Personal Data Might Travel
Your info (including Personal Data) is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means your info might be moved to and kept on computers outside of your state, province, country, or other government jurisdiction, where data protection laws might be different from yours.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and handing over such info, you're cool with this transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. No transfer of your Personal Data will happen to an organization or a country unless there are proper controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal info.

### Wiping Your Personal Data
You've got the right to wipe or ask for our help in wiping the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you delete certain info about yourself right from inside the Service.

You can always log into your account (if you've got one) and swing by the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, change, or delete it. You can also hit us up to ask for access to, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

But heads up, we might need to hang onto some info when we've got a legal obligation or a valid reason to do so.

### When We Might Spill Your Personal Data

#### Business Deals
If the Company gets tangled up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data gets transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
Under certain circumstances, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if we're legally required to or if public authorities (like a court or a government agency) come knocking with a valid request.

#### Other Legal Stuff
The Company might spill your Personal Data if we genuinely believe such action is necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation.
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property.
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected with the Service.
- Safeguard the personal safety of Service users or the public.
- Guard against legal liability.

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe
Keeping your Personal Data safe is a big deal to us, but remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% foolproof. While we bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Kids' Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kid has given us Personal Data, please get in touch. If we figure out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers.

If we need to lean on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't run. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We strongly suggest you peek at the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We've got no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a clear notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to check this Privacy Policy regularly for any tweaks. Changes to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page.
