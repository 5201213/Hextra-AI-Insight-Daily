Hey there! This **Privacy Policy** is all about how we handle your info – our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing it when you use our Service. It also spills the beans on your privacy rights and how the law has your back.

Just so you know, we use your **Personal Data** to power up and improve our Service. By using our Service, you're cool with us collecting and using your info as laid out in this Privacy Policy.

## Explanations and Definitions

### Explanations
Heads up! **Words capitalized** in this document have specific meanings, no matter if they're singular or plural. Check out the definitions below:

### Definitions
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:

- **Account**? That's your unique spot, created just for you to hop onto our Service or certain parts of it.

- **Affiliate** means a buddy entity that's either controlling us, controlled by us, or chillin' under common control with us. "Control" here means owning half or more of the voting shares, equity, or securities for electing directors or other management.

- **Company** (that's "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this whole agreement) means **AI Daily by Hexi 2077**.

- **Cookies** are tiny little files that websites stash on your computer, phone, or any other device. They're packed with details like your browsing history on that site, and lots of other useful stuff.

- **Country**? That's California, USA, folks!

- **Device** is pretty much anything you use to hit up our Service – think computers, phones, or even your digital tablet.

- **Personal Data** is any info that's linked to someone identifiable or already identified. Simple as that!

- **Service**? That's just a fancy word for this Website.

- **Service Provider** is basically anyone (or any company) we work with to process data for us. They're the third-party pros we hire to help run our Service, provide it for us, handle Service-related tasks, or even help us figure out how you're using it.

- **Usage Data** is the info that gets automatically collected when you're using our Service or from the Service's tech backbone itself. Think stuff like how long you spend on a page, for example.

- **Website**? That's **AI Daily by Hexi 2077**, and you can find it at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You** means... well, *you*! The person checking out or using our Service, or if you're doing it on behalf of a company or other legal entity, then that entity.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you're hanging out on our Service, we might ask for some **Personal Data** that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This could include, but isn't limited to: <br><br>- Your Email address<br>- Your Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Just so you know, **Usage Data** gets collected automatically whenever you're using our Service.

So, what's in this **Usage Data**? It might include your device's IP address, your browser type and version, which pages you visit on our Service, when you visit them, how long you hang out on those pages, unique device IDs, and other techy diagnostic info.

If you're accessing our Service on a mobile device, we might automatically collect some info like the type of mobile device you're using, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the kind of mobile browser you're rocking, unique device IDs, and other diagnostic deets.

And hey, we might also grab info your browser sends our way whenever you visit our Service, whether it's on a desktop or your mobile device.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
Alright, so we use **Cookies and similar tracking technologies** to keep an eye on activity on our Service and stash some info. These tech tools, like beacons, tags, and scripts, help us gather and track info, plus improve and analyze what we're doing. The specific tech we might use includes:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: These are just small files placed on your device. You can totally tell your browser to reject all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But, if you don't accept Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work for you. Unless you've already tweaked your browser settings to reject 'em, our Service will likely use Cookies.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and even our emails might have tiny electronic files called web beacons (you might also hear them called clear gifs, pixel tags, or single-pixel gifs). These let us, for example, count folks who've visited those pages or opened an email. They're also used for other cool website stats, like tracking how popular a section is or making sure our systems are running smoothly.

So, Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent ones stick around on your computer or phone even when you're offline, while Session Cookies vanish the second you close your browser. Poof!

We actually use both **Session and Persistent Cookies** for the reasons we're about to lay out:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Yours truly (that's us!)
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super vital for making sure you get all the services available on our Website and can use its cool features. They help us confirm who you are and stop any funny business with user accounts. Seriously, without these, the stuff you ask for just wouldn't work, so we only use them to get those services to you.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Yep, us again!
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies just let us know if you've given us the thumbs up to use cookies on the Website.

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Still us!
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are pretty handy because they help us remember your choices when you're using the Website – like your login info or what language you prefer. The whole point is to give you a more personal experience, so you don't have to keep re-entering your preferences every single time you visit.

Wanna know more about the Cookies we use and your options? Just swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of this Privacy Policy!

### How We Use Your Personal Data
So, the **Company** might use your **Personal Data** for these reasons:

- **To provide and keep our Service running smoothly**, which includes keeping an eye on how it's being used.
- **To manage your Account**: This means handling your registration as a user of the Service. The Personal Data you hand over helps you unlock all the different features available to registered users. Pretty neat, huh?
- **For contract fulfillment**: This is all about setting up, following through on, and completing the purchase contract for any products, items, or services you've bought, or any other agreement you've made with us via the Service.
- **To get in touch with you**: We might ping you via email, phone, SMS, or other digital ways (like push notifications from our mobile app). This is for updates or important info about features, products, or services you've signed up for – including security updates – whenever it's necessary or makes sense.
- **To keep you in the loop**: We'll send you news, special deals, and general info about other cool stuff we offer – goods, services, and events – that are similar to what you've already bought or asked about. Of course, this is unless you've told us you're not interested in getting such updates.
- **To handle your requests**: Pretty straightforward – this means dealing with and managing any requests you send our way.
- **For business transfers**: If we ever get into a merger, divestiture, restructuring, or sell off some or all of our assets (whether it's part of a regular business operation or something like bankruptcy), we might use your info to assess or go through with it. Your Personal Data, as a user of our Service, would be one of the assets transferred in such a case.
- **For other cool stuff**: We might also use your info for other purposes, like digging into data, spotting usage trends, figuring out how awesome our promotions are, and generally evaluating and making our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience even better!

We might share your **Personal Information** in these situations:

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your Personal Info with our Service Providers to help us keep an eye on how our Service is being used and to get in touch with you.
- **For business transfers**: If we're looking at a merger, selling off company assets, or getting acquired (either all or part of our biz), we might share or transfer your Personal Info during those talks or the process itself.
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our affiliates. Don't worry, though, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Affiliates mean our parent company, any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or any other companies we control or that are under the same control as us.
- **With business partners**: We might team up with our business partners and share your info so they can offer you some cool products, services, or promotions.
- **With other users**: Just a heads-up! If you share personal info or interact in public areas of our Service with other users, that info could be seen by everyone and even go public outside our platform.
- **With your OK**: With your permission, we might spill your Personal Info for any other reason you agree to.

### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The **Company** will only hang onto your **Personal Data** for as long as we absolutely need it for the purposes mentioned in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data as much as necessary to meet our legal duties (like if we need to hold onto your data to follow the law), sort out any disagreements, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are followed.

We'll also keep **Usage Data** for our own internal analysis. Generally, Usage Data isn't kept for too long, unless we're using it to boost our Service's security, improve its features, or if we're legally required to hold onto it for a longer stretch.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your info (yep, that includes your **Personal Data**) gets processed at our Company's offices and wherever else the folks involved in handling it are located. This means your info might zip over to and be stored on computers outside your state, province, country, or even other governmental areas. Just know that data protection laws in those places might be different from yours.

By saying 'yes' to this Privacy Policy and sending over your info, you're giving us the green light for that transfer.

The **Company** will do everything reasonably necessary to make sure your data is handled securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your **Personal Data** to any organization or country unless there are solid controls in place, including top-notch security for your data and other personal info.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to erase, or ask us to help you erase, the **Personal Data** we've collected about you. Your data, your call!

Our Service might even let you delete some of your info right from inside the Service itself. Pretty handy!

You can update, change, or delete your info anytime by just logging into your account (if you've got one) and heading to the account settings section where you can manage your personal details. Or, if you prefer, just hit us up and ask to access, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

Just a heads-up though: we might need to hang onto certain info if we've got a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so.

### Disclosing Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the **Company** ever gets into a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your **Personal Data** might get transferred. We'll make sure to give you a heads-up before your Personal Data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
Sometimes, the **Company** might have to spill your **Personal Data** if the law demands it, or if a public authority (like a court or government agency) sends us a valid request. We gotta play by the rules!

#### Other Legal Requirements
The **Company** might also disclose your **Personal Data** if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:
- Stick to our legal obligations
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
- Stop or look into any potential bad behavior connected to the Service
- Keep Service users or the public safe and sound
- Guard against legal trouble

### Security of Your Personal Data
The **security of your Personal Data** is a big deal to us, truly! But hey, remember, no method of sending stuff over the internet or storing it electronically is ever 100% bulletproof. While we bust our tails using top-notch, commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute, iron-clad security. Just keeping it real!

## Children's Privacy
Listen up, folks: Our Service isn't for anyone under 13. We absolutely do not knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under that age. If you're a parent or guardian and realize your kid has given us Personal Data, please hit us up ASAP! If we find out we've collected Personal Data from someone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll quickly move to delete that info from our servers.

If we ever need to rely on consent as a legal basis for handling your info, and your country says a parent's permission is a must, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Heads up! Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't run. If you click on a link to a third-party site, you'll be whisked away to *their* site. We *highly* recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Better safe than sorry!

Just so you know, we have absolutely no control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services out there. They're on their own!

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might tweak our **Privacy Policy** now and then. When we do, we'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the updated policy right here on this page.

Before any big changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a clear notice on our Service. We'll also update that "Last updated" date at the very top of this Privacy Policy. Transparency is key!

We recommend you check this **Privacy Policy** regularly for any updates. Just remember, any changes to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page. No surprises!
