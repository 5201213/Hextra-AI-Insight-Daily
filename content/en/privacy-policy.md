- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a tiny file placed on your device. You can tell your browser to refuse all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when a Cookie is being sent.

- **Web Beacons**: Certain sections of our Service and our emails might contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also called clear GIFs, pixel tags, and single-pixel GIFs).

### Use of Your Personal Data
The Company might use Personal Data for the following reasons:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**, including keeping an eye on how our Service is being used.

- **To contact You**: To hit you up via email, phone calls, SMS, or other similar electronic communication methods (like push notifications from a mobile app) about updates or informational messages related to the features, products, or contracted services, including security updates, when it's necessary or makes sense to do so.

- **To manage Your requests**: To handle and manage your requests to us.
- **For business transfers**: We might use your info to check out or go through with a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or any other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceedings, in which Personal Data held by us about our Service users is among the assets being transferred.
- **For other purposes**: We might use your info for other purposes too, like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promotional campaigns are, and to assess and amp up our Service, products, marketing, and your experience.

We might share your personal info in these situations:

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with Service Providers to keep an eye on and analyze how our Service is used, and to get in touch with you.
- **For business transfers**: We might share or transfer your personal info during or in negotiations of any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our Affiliates, and in that case, we'll make sure those Affiliates play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.
- **With Business Partners**: We might share your info with our Business Partners to hook you up with certain products, services, or promotions.

- **With your consent**: If you give us the thumbs up, we might spill your personal info for any other reason.

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to follow our legal obligations (like, if we need to hold onto your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also stash Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter spell, unless this data is used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or we're legally obligated to hold onto this data for longer periods.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means your info might be moved to — and kept on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws might differ from those in your neck of the woods.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're giving the green light to that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy, and no transfer of your Personal Data will happen to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal info.

### Delete Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask us to help delete the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the Service.

You can always log into your account (if you've got one) and swing by the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, modify, or get rid of your info. You can also hit us up to ask for access to, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

But just a heads-up, we might need to hang onto certain info when we've got a legal obligation or a legitimate reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets caught up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law enforcement
Under certain circumstances, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other legal requirements
The Company might spill your Personal Data if it genuinely believes such action is necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
- Guard against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
Keeping your Personal Data safe is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% foolproof. While we really try to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kid has given us Personal Data, please get in touch. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to ditch that info from our servers.

If we need to lean on consent as a legal basis for processing your info and your country requires a parent's OK, we might ask for your parent's consent before we gather and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get redirected to that third party's site. We super recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have zero control over, and don't take any responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right on this page.

We'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service before the changes kick in, and we'll update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to peek at this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.
