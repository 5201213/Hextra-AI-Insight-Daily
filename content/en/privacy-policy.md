### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use your Personal Data to the extent needed to follow our legal obligations (like, if we gotta keep your data to obey applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter period, unless that data is used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally required to hold onto this data for longer periods.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means your info might get shipped off to — and kept on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws might be different from yours.

By giving a thumbs up to this Privacy Policy and handing over such info, you're agreeing to that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are solid controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal info.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete your Personal Data or ask us to help you ditch the Personal Data we've scooped up about you.

Our Service might let you zap certain info about yourself right from inside the Service.

You can always log into your Account (if you've got one) and swing by the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, change, or wipe your info. You can also get in touch with us to ask for access to, correction of, or deletion of any personal info you've given us.

But heads up, we might need to hang onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a valid reason to do so.

### When We Might Share Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if it's required by law or in response to valid requests from public authorities (like a court or a government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might spill your Personal Data if we genuinely believe such action is necessary to:
- Play by legal rules
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
- Prevent or investigate possible screw-ups in connection with the Service
- Keep Service users or the public safe
- Guard against legal responsibility

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe
Keeping your Personal Data safe is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% foolproof. While we do our best to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Kids' Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kid has handed over Personal Data to us, please get in touch. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll take steps to scrub that info from our servers.

If we gotta lean on consent as a legal basis for processing your info and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parents' blessing before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't run. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We strongly suggest you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you swing by.

We have no control over, and don't take any responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

We'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service before the changes kick in, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to check this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are good to go when they're posted on this page.
