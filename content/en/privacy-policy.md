### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The Company will only keep your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to follow our legal obligations (like if we need to keep your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data is generally kept for a shorter period, unless it's used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally obligated to hold onto this data for longer periods.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your info (and yep, that includes Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing hang out. This means this info might get transferred to—and kept on—computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws might differ from your own turf.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're giving the thumbs-up to that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask us to help you delete the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you delete certain info about yourself right from within the Service itself.

You can always update, modify, or delete your info at any time by logging into your Account (if you've got one) and hitting up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. You can also reach out to us to ask for access to, correction of, or deletion of any personal info you've given us.

But hey, keep in mind that we might need to hang onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosing Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets into a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might be asked to spill your Personal Data if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or a government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might spill your Personal Data because we genuinely believe such action is necessary to:
- Play by the legal rules
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
- Shield against legal liability

### The Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is super important to us, but let's be real, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% foolproof. While we do our best to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has dropped some Personal Data our way, please get in touch with us. If we figure out we've scooped up Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to ditch that info from our servers.

If we need to lean on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's blessing before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Sites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to peek at this Privacy Policy regularly for any tweaks. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.
