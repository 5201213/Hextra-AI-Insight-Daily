### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will hold onto your Personal Data only for as long as it's necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent required to meet our legal obligations (like, if we need to keep your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data usually sticks around for a shorter period, unless it's used to beef up the security of our Service or boost its functionality, or if we're legally obliged to keep this data for a longer stretch.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means your info might get transferred to – and kept on – computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where data protection laws might differ from those in your jurisdiction.

By giving a nod to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're pretty much signing off on that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonable steps necessary to make sure your data is treated securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

### Delete Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete your Personal Data, or ask for our help in doing so, if we've collected it about you.

Our Service might even let you delete certain info about yourself right from within the Service.

You can always pop into your account (if you have one) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, modify, or delete your deets. You can also just get in touch with us to request access to, correct, or delete any personal info you've tossed our way.

But hey, please note, we might need to keep certain info if we've got a legal obligation or a legitimate basis to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain scenarios, the Company might be forced to spill your Personal Data if it's required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company may spill your Personal Data if it genuinely believes such action is necessary to:
-   Comply with a legal obligation
-   Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
-   Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet, or electronic storage, is ever 100% foolproof. While we totally bust our chops to use commercially acceptable means to guard your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly scoop up personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has slipped us Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we figure out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers.

If we need to lean on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We've got zero control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll give you a heads-up about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this very page.

Before the changes actually kick in, we'll let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
