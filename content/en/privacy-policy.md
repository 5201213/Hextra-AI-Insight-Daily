### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only keep Your Personal Data for as long as needed for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use Your Personal Data as much as necessary to stick to our legal obligations (like if we need to keep Your data to follow applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) is handled at the Company’s operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and sending in such info, You're giving the green light to that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure Your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy, and no transfer of Your Personal Data will happen to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of Your data and other personal information.

### Delete Your Personal Data
You’ve got the right to delete or ask Us to help delete the Personal Data We’ve collected about You.

Our Service might let You erase certain info about Yourself right from within the Service.

You can always log into Your account (if You have one) and hit up the account settings section that lets You manage Your personal info to update, change, or wipe out Your info. You can also get in touch with Us to ask for access to, correction of, or deletion of any personal info You’ve provided to Us.

But keep in mind, we might need to hang onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, Your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give You a heads-up before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law enforcement
Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).

The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation

- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
Keeping Your Personal Data safe is a big deal to Us, but remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We try our best to use commercially acceptable ways to protect Your Personal Data, We can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13.

If We find out We've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, We'll take steps to remove that info from Our servers.

If We need to lean on consent as a legal basis for processing Your info, and Your country requires parental consent, We might ask for Your parents' go-ahead before We collect and use that info.
