## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

Usage data is automatically collected when you use the service. (It just happens!)

Usage data might include your device's Internet Protocol address (like an IP address, for example), browser type, browser version, the pages you visit on our service, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. (Basically, all the techie bits about your visit!)

This includes, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you use, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. (All the juicy details about your mobile experience!)

When you visit our service, or access it through a mobile device, we may also collect information that your browser sends. (It's just how the internet works!)

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We use Cookies and similar tracking technologies to keep an eye on activity on our service and store certain information. These tracking technologies include beacons, tags, and scripts, all used to collect and track info and to improve and analyze our service. The tech we use might include:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a tiny file placed on your device. You can tell your browser to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being sent. However, if you don't accept Cookies, you might not be able to use certain parts of our service. Unless you've adjusted your browser setting to refuse Cookies, our service may totally use Cookies. (It's up to you, but we recommend 'em!)
- **Web Beacons**: Certain sections of our service and our emails may contain small electronic files called web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These awesome files permit the Company, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (like recording the popularity of a certain section and verifying system and server integrity). (Pretty neat, huh?)

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies stay on your personal computer or mobile device when you go offline, while Session Cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser. (Two types, two different behaviors!)

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the purposes outlined below:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely essential to provide you with services available through the Website and to enable you to use some of its features. They help to authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these Cookies to deliver those services to you. (Can't live without 'em!)

- **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies identify if users have accepted the use of cookies on the Website. (Just a quick check!)

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies allow us to remember the choices you make when you use the Website, like remembering your login details or language preference. The whole point of these Cookies is to provide you with a more personalized experience and save you from having to re-enter your preferences every single time you use the Website. (Super convenient!)

For more info on the Cookies we use and your choices regarding Cookies, feel free to visit our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy. (We've got all the details!)

- **To provide and maintain our Service**, including monitoring the usage of our Service. (That's our main gig!)

- **To contact you**: We'll reach out to you by email, telephone calls, SMS, or other equivalent forms of electronic communication (like push notifications from a mobile application) regarding updates or informative communications related to the functionalities, products, or contracted services, including security updates, when these are necessary or reasonable. (We'll keep you in the loop!)
- **To provide you with news**, special offers, and general information about other goods, services, and events which we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired about, unless you have opted not to receive such info. (Only the good stuff, unless you tell us not to!)

- **For business transfers**: We may use your info to evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Data held by us about our Service users is among the assets transferred. (Just in case things shake up!)

- **With your consent**: We may disclose Your personal information for any other purpose with your consent. (Your permission is key!)

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we're required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. (We don't keep it longer than we need to, unless the law says so!)

The Company will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally kept for a shorter period of time, unless this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally required to retain this data for longer periods. (Just enough to learn and grow!)

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information (including Personal Data) is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info may be transferred to â€” and maintained on â€” computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws might differ from those of your jurisdiction. (It might travel a bit!)

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. (By using our service, you're on board!)

The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. No transfer of Your Personal Data will happen to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information. (We've got your back!)

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You have the right to delete or request that we assist in deleting the Personal Data that we have collected about you. (It's your data, your call!)

Our service may give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the service itself. (Easy peasy!)

You may update, amend, or delete your information at any time by signing into Your Account (if you have one) and visiting the account settings section that allows you to manage your personal information. You can also totally contact us to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. (We're here to help you manage it!)

Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so. (Sometimes the law just says we have to!)

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be transferred. We'll provide notice before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy. (We'll keep you posted!)

#### Law enforcement
Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency). (Sometimes we have no choice!)

#### Other legal requirements
The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of Your Personal Data is super important to us! However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we totally strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. (We do our best, but no one's perfect!)

## Children's Privacy
Our service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we figure out that we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verification of parental consent, we'll take steps to remove that information from our servers. (Kids, gotta be safe online!)

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information, and your country requires consent from a parent, we may ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info. (We'll always follow the rules!)

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service may contain links to other websites that aren't operated by Us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be directed to that third party's site. We seriously advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. (Stay safe out there!)

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. (Just keeping it real!)

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll totally let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this very page. (Keep an eye out!)

Before the change becomes effective, we'll tell you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. (We'll make sure you know!)

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. (Better safe than sorry!)
