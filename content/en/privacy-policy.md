### Security of Your Personal Data
Keeping your Personal Data safe is a big deal to us, but let's be real, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% foolproof. While we do our best to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kid has given us Personal Data, please hit us up. If we find out we've scooped up Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to ditch that info from our servers.

If we gotta lean on consent as a legal basis for processing your info and your country needs parental consent, we might ask for your parent's approval before we gather and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get shunted over to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you take a peek at the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We've got no control over, and we don't take any responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

We might update our Privacy Policy now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by just slapping the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
