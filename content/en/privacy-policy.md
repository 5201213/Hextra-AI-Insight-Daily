If we discover that we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verification of parental consent, we'll take immediate steps to remove that information from our servers.

If we ever need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information, and your country requires parental consent, we may ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that information.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't operated by Us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend that you review the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit.
