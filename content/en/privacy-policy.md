### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we totally try to use commercially acceptable ways to keep your Personal Data safe, we can't guarantee it's absolutely watertight.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13.
