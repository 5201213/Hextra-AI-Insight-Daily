## Collecting & Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you're rockin' our Service, we might ask for some personal info that could totally help us get in touch or figure out who you are. This personal info might include, but isn't just limited to:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? It's automatically scooped up when you're using the Service. Poof! ‚ú®

Usage Data can spill the deets on things like your device's Internet Protocol address (think IP address), browser type and version, which pages of our Service you're checking out, when and how long you're chillin' on those pages, unique device IDs, and other techy diagnostic stuff. You get the idea! ü§ì

If you're hitting up the Service on your mobile device, guess what? We might auto-collect some info! This includes, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile device you're rockin', its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the mobile internet browser you're using, other unique device identifiers, and more diagnostic data. Pretty neat, huh?

Your browser might also send us info when you're just chillin' on our Service or hitting it up on your phone, and yeah, we might collect that too. Just so you know!

### Tracking Technologies & Cookies
We're talkin' Cookies and other cool tracking tech! They're our go-to for keeping tabs on what's happening on our Service and stashing away some info. These bad boys include beacons, tags, and scripts, and we use 'em to collect and track data, plus make our Service even better and dig into how you use it. The tech we're using could include:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie? Think of it like a tiny file chillin' on your Device. You can totally tell your browser to kick all Cookies to the curb or to give you a heads-up when one's trying to sneak in. But, fair warning: if you're not cool with Cookies, some parts of our Service might not play nice. Unless you've already tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the boot, our Service will likely be using them. Just sayin'!
- **Web Beacons**: Web Beacons? They're these tiny electronic files (also called clear GIFs, pixel tags, and single-pixel GIFs) you might find lurking in some parts of our Service or in our emails. They let the Company, for example, count folks who've checked out those pages or popped open an email, and help with other cool website stats (like how popular a section is, or making sure our systems and servers are running smooth). Pretty clever, right? üí°

Cookies come in two flavors: "Persistent" or "Session"! Persistent ones stick around on your personal computer or mobile device even when you're offline, while Session ones vanish the second you close your web browser. Poof! üí®

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for these purposes, so listen up:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are like the unsung heroes! They're super important for hooking you up with the services available through the Website and letting you use all its cool features. They also help us verify who you are and stop any shady business with user accounts. Seriously, without these Cookies, we can't deliver the goods you're asking for, so we only use 'em for that. They're non-negotiable! üí™

- **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are basically our little reminder system! They just check if you've given us the thumbs up for using Cookies on the Website. Simple as that! ‚úÖ

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are all about making your life easier! They let us remember your choices when you're cruising around the Website, like your login deets or what language you prefer. The whole point is to give you a super personalized experience, so you don't have to keep punching in your preferences every single time you visit. Pretty sweet, huh? üåà

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your info (yep, including your Personal Data!) gets processed right here at the Company's operating offices, plus anywhere else the folks doing the processing hang out.

If we discover we've accidentally snagged Personal Data from anyone under 13 without a parent's OK, we'll totally zap that info from our servers. Promise! üö´üßí

If we ever need your consent as the legal green light to process your info, and your country says a parent's gotta give the OK, then yep, we might ask for your parent's consent before we even touch that info. Just making sure we're on the up and up! üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶
