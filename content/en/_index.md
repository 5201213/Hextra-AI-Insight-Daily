### AI Product & Feature Updates
1.  Google **Firebase Studio** 🚀✨ just rolled out a big update, introducing a flexible **Agent mode** powered by **Gemini 2.5** (including Ask, Agent, and Agent Auto-run). Plus, there's a sneak peek at **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **Gemini CLI** integration support, all aimed at giving developers a super independent AI-assisted coding and app development experience. These new features guide AI behavior by defining rule files, let developers customize AI workflows, and have already rocked it in real-world projects like hydrogen economy platforms, fashion styling systems, Pokémon card management, and architectural design visualization tools.
