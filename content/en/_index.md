## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Stargazer"**
### **Chapter 7: Prometheus's Gift**

#### **1. (Ancient Times)**

**Kli's "gifts"** began appearing in the tribe's sight in a mysterious way.

Sometimes, it was an antelope, precisely speared through the throat with a stone spear, left right on their usual foraging path for the next morning. Other times, it was a large pile of nuts, neatly arranged on a flat rock not far from the cave, their hard shells already cracked open. Once, after a sudden downpour, they even found the cave entrance covered by a makeshift but effective shelter of large leaves and branches, keeping the cave floor dry.

These "gifts of Prometheus" barely allowed the tribe to survive through the harsh dry season.

But these gifts didn't bring gratitude; instead, they bred deeper fear and superstition.

The tribespeople couldn't fathom where these food and shelters came from. They couldn't see the lone figure protecting them in the shadows. With their limited imagination, they could only attribute it all to some supernatural power‚Äîa capricious "ghost god" roaming the plains.

The tribespeople began to worship these mysterious foods with primal reverence, howling in awe. **Gron**, the chieftain, tacitly allowed this behavior, even actively guiding it. After all, an unseen, ethereal "ghost god" was far easier for him to exploit and control than a visible **Kli** with extraordinary intelligence. He molded himself into the "ghost god's" sole "spokesperson" within the tribe, always being the first to step forward with ritualistic roars whenever new "gifts" appeared, before distributing the food.

Through this clever tactic, **Gron** ingeniously transformed the lifeline Kli provided into capital to solidify his rule. His authority, amidst this superstitious atmosphere, didn't wane but actually soared.

Only **Ona** vaguely guessed the truth.

**She** was still alive. Kli hadn't seen her last time because she'd broken her leg during a foraging trip and had been recuperating deep inside the cave. Her leg had healed, but she'd become even quieter than before.

**She** searched for Kli repeatedly within the tribe but couldn't find a trace of him. Yet, from those "gifts," she could discern Kli's unique marks‚Äîthe clean, precise wounds pierced by a stone spear; the smooth plant roots cut by sharp stone flakes. These were all "techniques" she had seen Kli use before, unmistakable and unique to him.

**She** knew Kli wasn't dead. He was nearby, protecting the tribe that had once abandoned him, in his own way.

This discovery filled **her** with immense sorrow. She tried hinting at it to her mother, and even to a few other young females, but they all stared at her like she was crazy, then ran away in fright, as if she, too, had caught some ominous taint. They preferred to believe in an illusory ghost god rather than accept the fact that an exiled peer possessed such abilities.

One night, **Ona** made a bold decision. She quietly slipped out of the cave while everyone was fast asleep. She brought her favorite necklace, strung with wild animal teeth‚Äîher only precious "possession." She wanted to find Kli, give it to him, and let him know that at least one person knew and was grateful for everything he had done.

**She** fumbled in the darkness, guided by intuition and her guesses about Kli's behavior patterns, heading towards the valley where she had previously found water.

However, **she** didn't find Kli. What she found instead was another, much bigger crisis.

At the entrance to that valley, **she** spotted a pack of hyenas. There were so many of them, far more than any hyena pack they'd seen before. They were clearly drawn by the remaining water source in the area and the scent of Kli's leftover prey. They didn't attack immediately but roamed around, observing the tribe inside the valley with extreme patience, like opportunists.

**Ona** was scared out of her wits. She knew that if this pack of hyenas discovered her tribe's weakness, they would launch a deadly attack without hesitation.

**She** scrambled back to the cave, waking everyone with urgent screams. When Gron and the other males rushed to the valley entrance and saw the dense mass of eyes glowing eerily green in the moonlight, a bone-chilling dread gripped everyone.

**Gron** immediately organized a defense. But they were too weak, and there were too few of them.

At this desperate moment, a reddish-orange glow suddenly appeared from the other side of the valley.

It was fire.

**Kli** appeared. He held a burning torch in one hand and his spear-thrower in the other. Alone, he stood on the flank of the hyena pack, like a war god descended from the heavens, wreathed in flames.

**Hyenas** have an innate fear of fire. Seeing the flickering flames, they immediately stirred, letting out uneasy growls.

**Kli** didn't hesitate for a second. He forcefully hurled the burning torch towards the densest part of the hyena pack. The torch landed on the dry grass, instantly igniting an area and forming a wall of fire, cutting off the hyenas' escape.

Then, using his spear-thrower, **he** precisely shot "fire arrows"‚Äîspears with oil-soaked kindling bound and lit at their tips‚Äîat the panicked hyenas.

The firelight, screams, and the stench of burning fur blended together, creating a hellish scene. The hyena pack completely collapsed, howling and scattering, quickly vanishing into the night.

The valley returned to calm.

The tribespeople stared blankly at it all, watching the figure who, torch in hand, had single-handedly repelled the entire hyena pack.

This time, it wasn't some distant, mysterious "gift." It was a living, undeniable "miracle." The "outcast" they had once driven away had, in a way they couldn't possibly comprehend, saved them again.

**Kli** slowly walked towards the cave entrance. The animal skins on his body flickered in the firelight, his face was blackened by smoke and flames, but his eyes, they glowed with astonishing brightness.

**Gron** watched him, his body trembling slightly. What he felt was no longer jealousy or threat, but a profound awe and fear of a higher power, originating from the deepest part of his being. The stone axe in his hand dropped to the ground with a "clang." Involuntarily, he slowly knelt down.

With the chieftain's kneeling, all the tribespeople, one by one, knelt down. They bowed their proud heads toward Kli, toward the peer they had once abandoned.

Only **Ona** did not kneel. She stood at the back of the crowd, tears streaming down her face. She was overjoyed by Kli's return, but she also saw that in the eyes of the kneeling tribespeople, there was no kinship, no understanding‚Äîonly the worship of a deity.

**Kli** stood before them, worshipped like a god by his own people.

However, **he** felt lonelier than ever. Because from this moment on, he knew he could never go back. He was no longer Kli, no longer their companion.

**He** had become the lonely "god" of their imagination.

#### **2. (Near Future)**

**Lin Yao's "digital ghost"** had been lurking in the "Pandora" base's network for 48 hours.

**It** was like a patient hunter, learning every heartbeat of the system, mimicking the disguise of every normal data packet, bypassing layer after layer of firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Finally, it found an opening‚Äîa relatively low-encryption port responsible for transmitting environmental monitoring data to Sector B7.

**It** succeeded.

When the first fragmented data streams from Sector B7's core server began flowing back to Lin Yao's lab terminal through that hidden backdoor, both she and **Ava Jensen** held their breath.

After being reassembled and decrypted, these data revealed not cold, hard code, but individual... life dossiers.

‚ÄúOh my God‚Ä¶‚Äù **Ava** clapped a hand over her mouth, her eyes wide with horror, ‚ÄúThese‚Ä¶ these are all people.‚Äù

The screen displayed detailed personal profiles: name, age, nationality, genetic map, and‚Ä¶ a score labeled "Cognitive Potential Index (CPI)." These individuals hailed from all corners of the globe‚Äîteenagers with extraordinary mathematical talent, scholars with eidetic memories, artists bursting with creativity, and even a few autistic individuals diagnosed with Savant Syndrome.

Their commonality was that in genetic tests, all showed a "semi-activated" state of the "Stargazer Gene."

For the past decade, **Prometheus Corporation** had been secretly seeking and monitoring these modern descendants of the "Stargazers" worldwide.

What truly chilled **Lin Yao** to the bone was that each dossier had a status marked at the end: "Recovered" or "To Be Recovered."

‚ÄúRecovered‚Ä¶‚Äù **Lin Yao** mumbled, ‚ÄúWhat do they treat these people as? Experimental subjects?‚Äù

‚ÄúWorse than that, I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù **Ava** pulled up another set of data: live surveillance footage of Sector B7. Since the "digital ghost" still had low-level permissions, the footage was blurry and unstable, but clear enough to make out the scene inside.

Sector B7 wasn't a data backup center at all.

**It** was a massive, circular life support hall. In the center of the hall stood a huge, blue-glowing cryogenic tank. Surrounding this tank were dozens of transparent "life support pods." Inside each pod lay a person, connected to various tubes and electrodes.

**They** were all in a deep coma. And their vital signs were connected, via those tubes, to that huge cryogenic tank in the center.

**They** were the people marked "Recovered" in the dossiers.

‚ÄúWhat is he doing? What exactly is Marcus up to?‚Äù **Ava‚Äôs voice** trembled.

**Lin Yao's gaze** was fixed on the central cryogenic tank. Her "digital ghost" had finally penetrated its surface data. When the internal structure diagram of that tank was parsed, Lin Yao felt a wave of dizziness.

Inside, it wasn't a machine, nor was it some AI core.

Inside‚Ä¶ was a brain.

A living human brain, stripped from its body, suspended in nutrient solution, and connected to external systems via countless fiber optic electrodes.

This brain was nearly 30% larger than a normal human brain. Its neuronal activity was tens of times stronger than human limits. And its energy supply came from the people in the surrounding life support pods‚ÄîMarcus was literally draining the brain bioelectricity from these "geniuses" like batteries to power this "superbrain."

‚ÄúAdam‚Ä¶ so ‚ÄòAdam‚Äô isn‚Äôt artificial intelligence,‚Äù **Lin Yao‚Äôs voice** was dry and hoarse, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a‚Ä¶ biological supercomputer, pieced and fused together from the brains of countless geniuses.‚Äù

**Marcus Thorne's madness** far surpassed her imagination. He wasn't trying to create an AI god; he was using the most elite human brains to "cultivate" a living "god."

The reason he needed **Lin Yao's** research was that this "superbrain," while powerful, remained unstable and lacked true, original creativity. He required the complete activation sequence of the "Stargazer Gene" as the final "ignition program" to truly integrate this "Frankenstein," cobbled together from countless brain fragments, into a unified "god" with self-awareness and boundless creativity.

This was the darkest secret Prometheus Corporation hid beneath "Eden."

‚ÄúWe have to stop him,‚Äù **Lin Yao** said, her voice soft but every word as hard as steel.

‚ÄúHow do we stop him?‚Äù **Ava** was on the verge of breaking down. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trapped here, he holds dozens of lives in his hands, and there‚Äôs a ‚Äòmonster‚Äô about to be born!‚Äù

**Lin Yao** didn't answer immediately. She walked to the lab window, gazing out at the meticulously designed, artificial tropical paradise.

**She** thought of Kli. She thought of that night when he stood alone, torch in hand, facing the entire hyena pack.

When your enemy is overwhelmingly powerful, and all your escape routes are sealed, the only thing you can do is become something even more dangerous, more unpredictable than it.

‚ÄúMarcus thinks the activation sequence for the ‚ÄòStargazer Gene‚Äô is a gift for his god,‚Äù **Lin Yao** slowly turned around, a near-mad glint in her eyes. ‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs give him a real ‚Äògift‚Äô instead.‚Äù

‚ÄúAva,‚Äù **she** said to her deputy, ‚Äúhelp me connect to the core of the ‚ÄòNeural Penetration‚Äô algorithm. I‚Äôm going to modify it. I‚Äôm going to turn it‚Ä¶ into a real ‚Äòvirus.‚Äô‚Äù

A virus that won‚Äôt just steal information, but‚Ä¶ can rewrite it.

‚ÄúHe wants to create a god? I‚Äôll make sure that god, the moment it's born, receives a‚Ä¶ greeting from the true ‚ÄòStargazer‚Äô of one and a half million years ago.‚Äù
