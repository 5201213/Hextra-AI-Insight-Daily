7. Baoyu's blog post takes a deep dive into the subtle differences between **Prompt**, **Prompt Engineering**, and **Context Engineering**! 🧠 He explains that a **prompt** is an "instruction" for an AI model; **prompt engineering** is the systematic process of designing, testing, and optimizing these instructions; and **context engineering** is the art and science of giving large language models the right information and tools to complete tasks most efficiently. Especially for **AI Agents**, this is crucial "inner strength"! 💡🛠️
