## AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Observer"
### Chapter 4: Echoes of Solitude

#### 1. (Ancient Times)

The sun rose and set, three times over. Kli (科力) walked alone across the desolate wilderness for three days. He had left his tribe's familiar territory, venturing into a world completely unknown to him. The landscape here was rougher, with sparse bushes clinging to the red earth like scabs, and the air thick with the scent of dust and dry grass.

Hunger and thirst relentlessly lashed at his body. His lips were cracked, his steps faltering. Several times, dehydration blurred his vision, nearly sending him tumbling. What kept him going was the unwavering "pattern" etched in his mind—an invisible arrow pointing east, woven from the paths of stars, shifting winds, and animal migration routes.

He learned to survive on his own. With sharp stone flakes he'd fashioned, he scraped edible tender layers from tough tree bark. He smashed open termite nests, using a slender straw to extract protein-rich insects. He even, by "pre-reading" the terrain, dug through moist sand deep within an almost completely dry riverbed to find a murky puddle just enough for him to stoop and lap a few mouthfuls.

This was a brutal yet equitable dialogue between him and nature. Without the tribe's protection, every calorie gained demanded an immense price.

Yet, in this ultimate solitude, his perceptive abilities sharpened to an unprecedented degree. He was no longer merely an ape-man foraging for food; he had become a true "Observer." He could tell if an animal carcass was nearby from a circling vulture's height. From a small pile of forgotten droppings, he could discern whether a grazing wildebeest or a fierce hyena had passed by.

The world, in his eyes, was no longer a chaotic collection of isolated events. It transformed into a vast, interconnected web. Every detail was a signpost, pointing to the next possibility.

On the evening of the fourth day, as Kli dragged his exhausted body up a low, rocky hill, he saw a sight that instantly revitalized his spirit.

Below the rocky hill lay a vast, bowl-shaped basin. Its terrain was much lower than the surrounding plains, and the vegetation in the center was noticeably lusher than anywhere he'd traveled. He could even spot a few tall acacia trees. Most importantly, he saw a group of baboons gathered at the basin's heart, which meant—water!

Kli almost tumbled down the rocky hill in his haste. As he finally pushed aside the last bush, a hidden underground pool appeared before him. It wasn't an open puddle but a natural well, surrounded by rocks, with water seeping from underground crevices. The pool was clear, reflecting the twilight sky.

He rushed to the water's edge, burying his entire head in the cool pool, gulping it down in large mouthfuls. The sweet spring water quenched his parched throat and insides, as if life itself was being poured back into his depleted body.

This was the triumph of his "foresight," the reward for leaving his tribe and seeking alone.

However, as the initial euphoria faded, a deeper sense of solitude washed over him. He had this life-saving spring all to himself, but what about his tribe? Where were they now? Were they still in the western mountains, enduring desperate thirst?

He thought of Ona's (奥娜) worried eyes, and of the young ones whimpering with hunger and thirst. Though he had been cast out and misunderstood, the connection of blood had not been broken.

Just then, he heard a familiar roar from a distance, filled with despair and exhaustion. It was Gron's (格隆) voice!

Kli immediately climbed an adjacent rise, looking towards the source of the sound. In the twilight's afterglow, he saw a stumbling procession – his tribe. They had circled back from the west, clearly having found nothing. They looked terrible; several elderly members had already collapsed and were being dragged by their companions. Even Gron, the strongest, swayed as he walked.

They were heading straight for death.

Without a moment's hesitation, Kli darted down the rise, running towards his tribe. As he ran, he let out loud, urgent roars.

When the tribesmen first saw Kli, their initial reaction was caution and hostility. But upon seeing his wet fur and energetic demeanor, their expressions changed.

Kli ran up to them, making no complex gestures. He simply pointed in the direction he had come from, then turned and ran, calling back invitingly as he went.

This time, the instinct for survival overrode all prejudice and doubt. After a brief commotion, the group followed Kli. They gambled their last reserves of strength on the companion they had once considered an "outsider."

When Kli led the tribe to the hidden water pool, the entire group erupted in excitement. They rushed to the water's edge, drinking greedily, washing off the dust and fatigue with the water. The joy of being saved temporarily washed away all barriers.

Ona walked over to Kli, gently rubbing her cheek against his shoulder. It was the most direct way to express gratitude and closeness.

Kli watched his tribe, immersed in joy, and for the first time, felt a warmth in his heart. His "difference" had truly protected the tribe for the first time.

But when he looked at Gron, the chief, that warmth quickly cooled.

Gron, having drunk his fill and regained his strength, looked at Kli, surrounded by the tribe, with complex eyes. There was gratitude, confusion, but more so, a sense of trepidation and unease from his authority being shaken. He couldn't grasp how Kli had found this place. In Gron's worldview, this couldn't have been achieved through observation and thought; it felt more like... witchcraft. A power he couldn't comprehend or control.

Kli had saved the tribe, but he had also pushed himself into an even more dangerous position. He was no longer just an out-of-place "outsider"; he had become a potential challenger to a "new chief," an unpredictable entity possessing mysterious power.

Amidst the tribesmen's cheers of survival, only Kli heard the echoes of solitude. He knew this war for survival was far from over.

#### 2. (Near Future)

Prometheus Corporation's South Pacific Private Island – "Elysium."

The name was steeped in myth, and the island itself truly resembled a creation of legend. When Lin Yao's (林遥) maglev shuttle rose from the underground tunnel, seeing the island in its entirety for the first time, she couldn't help but be struck by its awe-inspiring beauty.

Azure waters encircled the verdant island, with white sand beaches ribboning along its edges. At the island's center, instead of luxurious resort villas, stood a futuristic circular structure built from white nanomaterials and high-strength glass—the Prometheus Asia Gene Research Center. This was the "golden cage" Marcus Thorne (Marcus Thorne) had built for her.

"Welcome to your kingdom, Dr. Lin." Marcus, standing beside her, presented his domain like a proud monarch.

The laboratory conditions were beyond imagination. The world's top ultra-high-speed gene sequencers, AI-assisted data analysis matrices, quantum computers capable of simulating protein folding... Equipment that would require months of waiting to use even once elsewhere became her exclusive tools here.

"Your team has arrived," Marcus said, leading her through the spotless corridor. "We've recruited the best genetic engineers, neuroscientists, and bioinformaticians from around the world for you. They answer only to your command."

Lin Yao spotted her mentor, Professor Chen (陈教授). He stood before a massive holographic data console, his expression grave. Seeing Lin Yao, he approached her and whispered, "Xiao Yao, the conditions here... they're too good. So good it's terrifying."

"I know," Lin Yao replied. "We're like knights invited to a dragon's lair, with the dragon showing us all its treasures."

"Just so we'll willingly help it hatch its eggs," Professor Chen said, cutting straight to the chase.

Over the next week, Lin Yao immersed herself completely in her work. The skull fossil, named "Kli-01," was placed in the lab's most central location. With the aid of supercomputers, they quickly decoded the full sequence of the "Observer Gene."

The results were even more astonishing than they had anticipated.

"It's not just a 'pattern processor'," Lin Yao explained at an internal meeting, gesturing at the gene map on the holographic screen. "It's more like the foundational code for a 'brain operating system.' It optimizes how the brain processes visual and auditory information, and it vastly enhances 'working memory' and 'long-term scenario simulation' capabilities. Simply put, anyone with this gene can build a model of the future a hundred times more complex than average in their brain and run simulations."

A neuroscientist added, "This explains why that ancient human could 'foresee' droughts. He didn't have superpowers; his brain could integrate more dimensions of environmental information—astrology, climate, animal behavior—and compute the most probable outcome. It was extreme rationality, yet in a primitive human, it manifested as a divine revelation."

Marcus sat quietly in a corner of the conference room, listening with a satisfied smile on his face.

Research progressed at lightning speed, but Lin Yao's inner unease grew day by day. She discovered that she and her team were being perfectly isolated from the outside world by "Elysium." Their external communications were under strict surveillance, and all research data was stored on independent servers within the island, physically cut off from outside access.

She indeed had primary control over the research, but the "fruits" of that research were firmly in Marcus's hands.

Late one night, as Lin Yao was in her room, trying to contact the outside world through an encrypted back door disguised as an academic forum, a knock came at her door.

It was Professor Chen.

"Xiao Yao, I've found something." Professor Chen's expression was unusually serious; he locked the door behind him and turned on a small signal jammer.

"What did you find?"

"I used my clearance to look into some of Prometheus Corporation's past research projects," Professor Chen said, his voice barely a whisper. "Before your 'Observer Gene,' they made at least three attempts at artificial 'intelligence enhancement' gene editing, all of which failed. Without exception, the test subjects developed severe cognitive impairments and eventually suffered mental breakdowns."

Lin Yao's heart sank.

"They weren't trying to create something from scratch; they wanted to find a perfect 'template' to fix their failed work," Professor Chen said, enunciating each word. "The 'Observer Gene' is the template they've been searching for. They don't care what loneliness or tragedy this gene might bring to an individual. They just want to replicate its function and turn it into a mass-producible, stable 'product.'"

Lin Yao finally understood the true meaning of Marcus's "Welcome to write a new chapter." He wasn't asking her to interpret history; he wanted her to engineer the future.

Outside the window, Elysium's perfect artificial nightscape lay. Palm trees swayed under soft lights, and the sound of ocean waves was filtered to a mere whisper by the soundproof glass.

But in Lin Yao's eyes at that moment, this beautiful island had transformed into a real, cold prison. She and her team, along with that ancient gene that had slept for millions of years, had all become prisoners within this facility.

And she was the warden who had, key in hand, walked into the cage herself.
