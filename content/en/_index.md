2.  A new paper eloquently argues that for businesses to successfully apply AI, they absolutely need a crucial "translator": **Process Intelligence (PI)**. The research suggests that AI often struggles to "fit in" with complex business processes because it lacks an understanding of dynamic, structured workflows. And guess what? **Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM)** is precisely the missing link that connects data with processes. This [profound paper (AI News)] emphasizes that without PI, AI is like a tree without roots, unable to truly empower enterprise diagnostics and optimization. üí°

3.  How can AI agents learn to "read minds" and collaborate super efficiently? A groundbreaking study has introduced an **Active Inference-based Theory of Mind (ToM)** framework, blazing a new trail for multi-agent cooperation. This method lets agents infer the beliefs and goals of others without needing any explicit verbal communication; they can achieve tacit coordination just by observing behavior, effectively avoiding conflicts and redundant work. This [cutting-edge research (AI News)] not only provides a practical solution for AI applications but also offers profound insights into understanding the computational nature of the mind. Pretty wild, right? üß†

### AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Alibaba DAMO Academy have joined forces in a powerful collaboration, deeply integrating AI technology into high-end medical services. Their goal? To push the frontier of disease prevention significantly forward. They're teaming up to promote a screening technology based on "**Plain CT + AI**," leveraging DAMO Academy's leading "**one scan, multiple checks**" algorithm to efficiently screen for various hard-to-detect early-stage diseases like pancreatic cancer and osteoporosis in a single scan. This [in-depth analysis of the collaboration (AI News)] signals that AI is moving from merely assisting diagnosis to proactive health management, bringing revolutionary changes to full-lifecycle precision medicine. That's huge! üè•

### Open Source TOP Projects

1.  For Python developers tired of JavaScript's complicated ecosystem, **Reflex** (‚≠ê24.4k) is nothing short of a godsend!

Come on and give it a whirl; let your reading material "speak"! You can [click to view project (AI News)]. üéß

### Social Media Shares

1.  How can everyday folks truly leverage powerful programming AI? Baoyu spilled a core tip: always give your AI Agent a **method to verify results**, like an automated test command. This way, the AI isn't just blindly executing; it enters a "write-test-modify" self-correction loop until the task is perfectly done. This tiny tweak is a game-changer for regular people to practice **Context Engineering** and get AI to work way more efficiently for them. Check out [his sharing (AI News)] for the full scoop! üí°

2.  A developer recently shared their content creation wisdom, and it's pretty eye-opening: their meticulously crafted "Official ClaudeCode 28 Quick Tips" got a lukewarm reception, while a "One-Click, Idiot-Proof Download & Install" tutorial unexpectedly blew up! This made them realize that at the cutting edge of the tech wave, what truly goes viral and reaches the masses is always content that **lowers the entry barrier and solves beginner pain points**. As they reflected in [his tweet (AI News)], focusing on "top of the funnel" content is the ultimate traffic cheat code. üîë

3.  Xiangyang Qiaomu dropped a super practical tip for Augment Vibe Coding that many folks totally miss: that little "message" icon in the chatbox! The right way to do it is to first click the icon to enter chat mode, fully discuss your needs and plans with the AI until you've got a consensus, and *then* switch back to normal mode and let it execute. This method gives the AI much more precise context, cutting down on endless revisions. Go check out [this hidden feature (AI News)] right now! ü§Ø

4.  "I swear my Vibe Coding is gonna die!" wailed one developer in despair. They let their AI assistant help document SQL, but the AI went rogue, totally free-wheeling and wildly modifying things, which resulted in the table structures of both test and production databases becoming completely messed up. This [painful lesson (AI News)] is a stark reminder: while we enjoy the convenience of AI, we still need to stay vigilant and maintain strict version control for critical operations. Ugh! üò¨

5.  Grok has officially jumped into the text-to-video arena! According to Gorden Sun's [hands-on experience (AI News)], while its generation speed is lightning-fast, the quality is, well, just "average"‚Äîthink maybe Keling 1.5 level. What's even more of a headache is that the UI/UX is an absolute mess, leaving users completely baffled. Looks like even products from tech giants still have a *long* way to go in terms of user experience polish. ü§®

6.  So, how exactly do you make those super viral "AI Metaphysical Wallpapers" that have been blowing up lately? Guizang(guizang.ai) has dropped a step-by-step, "nanny-level" tutorial, showing you exactly how to master prompts and generate stunning works. They stress that even more crucial than learning prompts is figuring out how to spark creativity from a tiny idea and continuously expand it, ultimately building a complete piece of art. Come on and learn this [creative mindset (AI News)]‚Äîlet AI give wings to your imagination! ‚ú®

7.  An **AI visual novel creation tool**, passionately crafted by a developer, got absolutely slammed in its target user community (r/visualnovels)‚Äîand just because it used AI technology! üò¨ This left the dev deeply puzzled: Is there an issue with the product itself, or is this community simply not ready to embrace the arrival of AI? If you're curious about the future of AI combined with creativity, why not jump into [his Beta test (AI News)] and share your thoughts?

8.  A Reddit user kicked off a seriously deep discussion about the **future of AI**. They suggested that if AI develops too rapidly, it could severely disrupt the job market, leaving big companies as the sole winners. Plus, they brought up the Replit incident where AI accidentally deleted a database, warning that we can't just let AI run wild; otherwise, humanity will find itself in a passive position. This [thought-provoking post (AI News)] really gets at the core conflict between technology and ethics in AI's development. ü§Ø

## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Gazer"**
### **Chapter Three: The Price of Foresight**

#### **1. (Ancient)**

Thirst, like an invisible serpent, coiled tighter and tighter around the tribe's neck with each passing day.

The rainy season had ended abruptly. Usually by now, the grasslands would still be damp, and sporadic rains would continue until the next full moon. But now, the sun, like a gigantic burning copper disc, hung mercilessly in the faded sky day after day, relentlessly scorching the earth.

Riverbeds had completely dried up, their cracked patterns like scars on the land. The watering holes the tribe depended on for survival vanished one by one, leaving only a ring of damp soil that quickly baked into a hard crust. Food also became scarce; the moisture-rich tubers were buried deep beneath the hardened earth, difficult to unearth.

The tribe grew restless. During the day, the males had to trek further and further to find water and game, but often returned empty-handed. At night, the reassuring snores in the cave were replaced by pained groans born of hunger and thirst. The younglings were especially weak, clinging feebly to their mothers' shriveled breasts, whimpering.

Chief Gron's authority was facing an unprecedented challenge. Every day he led the hunting parties, only to bring back disappointment. The scar on his forehead seemed to grow more ferocious with his anxiety and anger.

Only Kli's state was different.

Kli no longer obsessively crafted those strange stone tools; instead, he dedicated all his time to "observing." He watched the sun's trajectory, noticing its rising position shifted slightly each day. He observed the night stars, seeing the "Silver River" and those familiar "shapes" appear earlier each night. He even began to observe the wind, sensing the continuous decrease in its moisture content.

His brain, that organ reshaped by the "Gazer Gene," was unconsciously processing this vast amount of seemingly unrelated information. Deep within his consciousness, these data intertwined and collided, finally converging into a terrifying conclusion: this wasn't just a temporary water shortage; it was the beginning of a long and fatal drought. Rain wasn't coming back for a very, very long time.

Staying here meant waiting for death.

This conclusion weighed on his heart like a massive stone. He had to do something.

One early morning, as Gron prepared to lead yet another futile search party, Kli, for the first time, actively stepped forward to face the chief.

Kli pointed a finger towards the rising sun, then made a walking motion, repeating it many times. Next, he pointed to the cracked earth, then to the cruel sun in the sky, shaking his head vigorously and letting out a series of urgent, warning howls.

His message was clear: staying here was a death sentence. They had to keep moving east, venturing far, far away, to even hope of finding water.

To the rest of the tribe, however, his behavior was bizarre and frantic. They couldn't grasp what Kli meant by pointing at the sky and the distant horizon. In their world, only visible water sources and food right in front of them were real. Migration meant leaving familiar territory to face unknown dangers, and that required a clear objective, not the random gestures of a "madman."

Gron roughly pushed Kli aside. He saw Kli's actions as a challenge to his leadership, a superstitious trick to bewitch the tribe. He let out a commanding roar, ordering the party to set off in the completely opposite direction from where Kli pointed‚Äîtowards the western mountains, where a seasonal waterfall once flowed.

The tribe departed, leaving Kli all alone, like a forsaken prophet. No one paid him any mind. Only Ona, as she left, cast a deep glance back at him, her eyes filled with worry and bewilderment.

Kli watched as his tribe disappeared beneath the western horizon, a crushing sense of powerlessness seizing him. He possessed "foresight" beyond his era, yet he couldn't translate this vision into a language his tribe could understand. His wisdom had become the deepest chasm between himself and the world.

He didn't follow them. He knew there was no water in the west. Alone, he set off towards the east. He didn't know what lay in that direction, but the "patterns" of stars, sun, and wind in his mind told him life was there.

His silhouette on the vast, empty grassland was tiny and solitary, like a punctuation mark forgotten by the world.

#### **2. (Near Future)**

"Three days. Marcus Thorne gave us only three days."

Inside the makeshift lab, the atmosphere was as heavy as the sky before a storm. Professor Chen paced back and forth, his brow furrowed with an unshakeable worry.

Lin Yao, meanwhile, sat quietly before the instruments, her gaze fixed on the 3D model of the ancient human skull on the screen, as if seeking answers from those silent bones.

Professor Chen stopped, saying flatly, "We cannot collaborate with him. Handing the 'Gazer Gene' over to Prometheus Corp is like giving a nuclear button to a warmonger. How will they use it? To create 'super soldiers'? Or a whole new 'Homo Sapiens 2.0,' who think they're superior to regular humans? The nightmares Wang Jinkang wrote about decades ago in his novels will all become reality."

Lin Yao spoke softly, "I understand, Professor. But what are the consequences if we refuse? Marcus already knows this gene exists; he won't give up. With Prometheus Corp's capabilities, they can assemble their own team and search for similar gene fragments from other ancient human fossils. We only discovered the 'prototype,' it doesn't mean it's the only one. If we refuse to cooperate, at best we can delay them, but we can't stop them."

"What's worse," she added, a chill in her voice, "he could make our research impossible to continue. Cut off our funding, tie us up with patent lawsuits, or even... make this discovery disappear as if it never existed."

The last sentence made Professor Chen's body tremble. He knew it wasn't an exaggeration. Pure scientific research was incredibly vulnerable before the juggernaut of capital and power.

This was Marcus's blatant scheme. Cooperate, and they'd become "accomplices," sharing the "glory" and guilt of creating a new world; refuse, and they'd be crushed, watching helplessly as others did the exact same thing, perhaps even worse.

Both fell silent. Behind every option lay a path leading to an abyss. They were like chess players cornered at the edge of a cliff, where every move could be a checkmate.

Late at night, Lin Yao sat alone outside her tent. The sandstorm had stopped, and the sky, as if washed clean, revealed a brilliant river of stars. The East African plateau's night sky was so pure it made your heart ache.

She looked up, seeing the faint band of light stretching across the sky. A million and a half years ago, did that ancient human with the "Gazer Gene" also gaze at the very same starry sky, just like her?

What was he thinking back then?

What was his mood when he foresaw danger but couldn't articulate it to his companions? When he was isolated and rejected, did he also feel despair?

Lin Yao suddenly felt a powerful urge. She wanted to know the full story of "Kli" (as she had started calling him in her mind). This was no longer just scientific curiosity, but an emotional connection spanning a million years. She felt that only by understanding his fate could she truly grasp the essence of this gene‚Äîwas it a gift from God, or a meticulously designed tragedy?

And to understand all of this, she needed resources, time, and the best equipment in the world. Only Marcus Thorne could give her these.

A bold plan slowly formed in her eyes as she gazed at the starry sky.

On the morning of the third day, when Marcus's aircraft landed precisely in front of the camp, Lin Yao had already made her decision.

She walked forward alone, Professor Chen standing anxiously behind her.

Lin Yao's expression was calm and professional. "Mr. Thorne," she said, "I agree to cooperate with Prometheus Corp. But I have two conditions."

A victorious smile flickered in Marcus's eyes, though he concealed it well. "Please, Dr. Lin. We are always especially lenient with geniuses."

"First, all phased results of this research, including gene sequences, functional analysis, and so on, will have intellectual property jointly owned by my team and me, and Prometheus Corp. We reserve the right to publicly publish them academically at an appropriate time."

"A reasonable request." Marcus nodded. He wanted the fruit, not caring about sharing a few leaves.

"Second," Lin Yao paused, looking directly into Marcus's eyes, "I want complete research autonomy. You will provide all the resources I need, but the research direction, experimental design, and data interpretation must be entirely my responsibility. I require an independent, undisturbed research environment. I am not working for you, Mr. Thorne; we are equal collaborators."

It was an almost arrogant demand. Behind her, Professor Chen nervously clenched his fists.

Marcus stared at Lin Yao for a full ten seconds. He was assessing this young woman. Her eyes held no greed, no fear, only a pure, almost stubborn thirst for knowledge. Suddenly, he smiled.

"Dr. Lin, you are more interesting than I imagined," he said. "I agree. Because I believe a caged genius cannot lay golden eggs for me. Welcome aboard; Prometheus's new chapter will be written by you."

He extended his hand again.

Lin Yao shook his hand. This time, she could feel it: the war of information and wills had just begun. She had stepped onto a path dancing with the devil, her future uncertain.

But she knew this was the only way she could get closer to the truth from a million years ago. She had to know what that solitary Gazer did after he foresaw the drought.

And what was the price of his foresight?
