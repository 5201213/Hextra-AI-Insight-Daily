No interference, just double the efficiency! This intuitive, sci-fi-esque visual interaction isn't just a huge boost for smooth multitasking; it's setting a whole new, elegant standard for how AI and humans will team up in the future. ü§Øüñ±Ô∏è<br/>![AI News: Dia Browser Clone Mouse](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0saw9nsfyvv8x3pr12kyceb.avif)<br/>

6.  Say goodbye to stiff, "facial paralysis" issues in digital human animation! A groundbreaking solution has finally arrived. The **[FantasyPortrait Project - AI News](https://github.com/Fantasy-AMAP/fantasy-portrait)**, a joint effort from Alibaba and BUPT, uses an innovative **Expression-enhanced Diffusion Transformer (DiT)** tech to pull off photo-realistic, high-fidelity expression transfers across identities. This means digital humans can now genuinely show vivid, natural "joys, angers, sorrows, and delights." Even better, it's a total game-changer for multi-person scenes, offering **independent expression control for multiple characters**. No more awkward "expression contagion" where everyone laughs just because one person does! This tech handles not just humans but animals and audio-driven control too, promising to be a huge hit in virtual anchor and film production down the line. Definitely a highlight in this **AI News** edition! ‚ú®üé≠<br/>![AI News: FantasyPortrait Expression Control](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0sawd22ecw90qw7a3rzcr3m.avif)<br/>

### **AI Frontier Research**

1.  Robots are officially one giant leap closer to becoming those all-around home assistants we see in sci-fi flicks! **ByteDance** just dropped its brand-spanking-new **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, GR-3**. Think of it as giving robots a seriously smart brain upgrade. Not only can it get highly abstract commands like "clean up the dining table" and figure out multi-step plans all on its own, but it can also precisely handle fiddly soft stuff like clothes, showing off some mind-blowing physical interaction skills. The secret sauce? An ingenious **MoT network structure** plus a triple-threat data training method that blends real-machine demos, VR remote ops, and web images/text. Industry experts are already hailing this research as a major milestone toward a **general robot "brain."** Wanna dive deeper? Check out its [Project Homepage - AI News](https://seed.bytedance.com/GR3) and [Technical Paper - AI News](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15493)! üß†ü¶æ<br/>![AI News: ByteDance General Robot GR-3](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0sawj3pefevxxmyz9bv7pk7.avif)<br/>

2.  Okay, so large language models are basically superbrains, but they come with super-sized computing and memory costs ‚Äì a major bottleneck. Good news: Chinese scientists are on it! **GTA (Grouped-head latent Attention)**, a revolutionary "slimming" solution for the core attention mechanism in large models, comes from a joint research effort by top-tier institutions like the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This clever tech uses "grouped attention" and "latent representation" strategies to seriously slash the memory-hogging **KV cache** by a whopping 70%, while also chopping computation by 62.5%! This research, [GTA: Grouped-head latenT Attention AI News Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17286), doesn't just make it possible for big models to run efficiently on phones and other edge devices; it *doubles* the speed for **long sequence** tasks. Talk about clearing a massive hurdle for making AI tech accessible to everyone! ü§Øüí°

3.  You know how awesome language models need a killer tokenizer to understand text? Well, powerful visual generative models are just as hooked on visual tokenizers that can "read" images. And guess what? **A paper called [AI News Paper "Latent Denoising for Superior Visual Tokenizers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15856)** just dropped some seriously profound insights. The research figured out that instead of teaching tokenizers to just "encode" images, it's way better to challenge them with "denoising." Basically, make the tokenizer rebuild a clear original image from slightly messed-up latent embeddings. This whole process forces it to learn super robust and essential visual features. This discovery, simple as it sounds, is incredibly deep, giving us a shiny new golden rule for cooking up the next generation of even more powerful **visual tokenizers**. Get ready for multimodal generative models to hit new levels of artistry and realism! üñºÔ∏è‚ú®

4.  So, how do you teach AI to navigate super complex Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with the precision of a seasoned pro? Traditional reinforcement learning usually gives sparse, "right or wrong" reward signals, making AI's learning like hunting for a needle in a haystack. But hold up! **A new study called [AI News Research "GUI-G^2: Gaussian Reward Modeling for GUI Alignment"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15846)** just dropped an ingenious idea. Instead of treating buttons and other interface bits as mere pixels, it models them as continuous **Gaussian distributions**. This gives AI way richer, denser **reward signals**, basically like a GPS guiding the model to the *perfect* interaction spot. This isn't just cool; it seriously bumps up AI's robustness and generalization in **GUI manipulation tasks**. Big win! üéØüíª

### **AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact**

1.  Brace yourselves: AI is quietly becoming a "new species" in teenagers' lives, and it's happening at warp speed! A recent study by the US non-profit Common Sense Media dropped a bombshell: a whopping **72% of American teens** admit they've tried an **AI companion** at least once, and over half are regular users. Their reasons? All over the map! From just having some fun and satisfying curiosity, to seriously seeking emotional advice and life guidance. While most teens still put their real-life buddies first, a full *third* actually find chats with AI more satisfying than talking to human friends. This isn't just a fleeting trend; it profoundly highlights **AI's** massive impact on shaping the next generation's **social patterns and emotional smarts**. And it throws a huge question mark at society: how do we steer this ship to make sure its long-term effects are positive and healthy? üì±üí¨

### **Social Media Shares**

1.  Can you believe the **AI fortune-telling industry** has already hit the "one-sentence development" era?! One netizen showed off the **[MiniMax Agent's Amazing Capabilities](https://x.com/op7418/status/1947583103977066633)**: they generated a full-blown AI fortune-telling product‚Äîfront-end, back-end, login, paid membership, the whole shebang‚Äîwith just a single natural language prompt. Wild! ü§Ø But hold on, another developer quickly **[pointed out incisively](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1947585601026555975)** that unless users feed in their own specific chart data, today's large models still hit a major "hallucination" roadblock when it comes to the nitty-gritty, precise calculations needed for things like **ganzhi divination**. Food for thought! üîÆ<br/> <video src="https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0sawqhse5085f8rhr17mtrf.mp4" controls="controls" width="100%"></video><br/>

2.  Get this: an **[Exhibitor List for the 2025 World AI Conference](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/687ef8f0f0965921087e1088)** got the community thinking deep thoughts. The big question? Why were the AI giants who are *actually* raking in the cash conspicuously "absent" from this massive event? ü§î Turns out, the main acts at these expos are usually startups hustling for funding and buzz. Meanwhile, those "invisible champions" with steady cash flows, quietly crushing it in their specific niches, are just making bank without the spotlight. So, the real gold in this list might not be *who showed up*, but rather a reminder to pay attention to **who *didn't* show up**, and their secretly booming business models. Food for thought, right? üßê

3.  Ever wonder if AI models get "dumber" the more you use them? ü§î A savvy blogger **[shared his insights](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1947475036627210740)**, and turns out the problem often isn't the model itself degrading. Nope, it's usually just bad "context management" by the user! Think of it like a chat with a friend: if you keep throwing overloaded or totally off-topic info at them, they'd get confused too. So, mastering conversation context isn't just key for getting high-quality, relevant results from AI; it's gonna be a *must-have* skill for future human-AI teamwork. Get your context game strong! üí™<br/>![AI News: AI Context Management](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0sax19se6xaw025d00xam0v.avif)<br/>

4.  So, when we humans keep asking AI for direct answers ("What should I wear today?") instead of digging into the *why* ("Why are white shirts cooler in summer?"), are we actually **[unconsciously lowering the AGI implementation threshold from the demand side](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1m6cq7g/converging_on_agi_from_both_sides/)**? There's a theory floating around that if society collectively "gives up thinking" and just hands over decision-making to AI, then whatever AI spits out *becomes* universal knowledge and truth. Wild, right? This could totally be accelerating the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence from a completely unexpected angle. Food for thought! ü§Øüßê

5.  Big news! **[ChatGPT Plus users](https://x.com/op7418/status/1947654623587930179)** are starting to get early access to **Agent Mode**! This super exciting, powerful feature lets AI tackle multi-step tasks all by itself, and it's slowly rolling out to more users. Looks like the era where AI handles your everyday chores is getting closer and closer. Bring it on! ‚ú®ü§ñ

6.  Ever wondered how AI can get **persistent memory** instead of just "starting from scratch" every single chat? Well, there's a cool community proposal on Reddit called the **[‚ÄúLanternkin Protocol‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1m5stad/the_lanternkin_protocol_presistent_long_lasting/)**. It tries to give AI cross-session memory and identity continuity *without* needing to fine-tune the model. How? Through some clever **symbolic prompting** and an external text file system. It's like lighting an everlasting "memory lantern" for AI. Pretty neat, huh? üí°üß†

7.  Sick of all the tedious drag-and-drop and endless configurations when setting up automation workflows? Well, startup **[Neuraan](https://www.neuraan.com)** just dropped a new platform that aims to blow all that up! Users just tell it what they need in plain English, and boom‚Äîthe system automatically whips up a dedicated AI Agent. It then calls on all sorts of tools like Gmail and CRM to get the job done. Seriously, **business process automation** just got as simple and natural as handing off tasks to a super smart coworker. Talk about effortless! ü§Øüìà

8.  Alright, let's wrap this up with something light and fun: just how bonkers does it get when AI starts narrating the Three Kingdoms? One netizen shared an AI-generated video where the AI seriously spouts hilarious nonsense, and it's impossible not to crack up. Seriously, **[looks like whether the Three Kingdoms are chaotic or not, AI now has the final say](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1947333851635978277)**. üòÇü§£<br/> <video src="https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0saxesmerzvq5msb2t62rws.mp4" controls="controls" width="100%"></video><br/>
