### **Social Media Shares**

1.  Right now, AI models like **Claude Code** and other **agents** still tend to gobble up more **tokens** to boost their success rate – basically, the "dumb way" of trying repeatedly until they get it right. 😅 But get this, this seemingly "clumsy" strategy also hints that the real era of **AI efficiency** could be just around the corner, maybe in about half a year! 🤯 ['more details'](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1944029058171314602)
2.  Mind-blowing! 😲 **Kimi K2**'s open-sourcing has totally revealed the awesome power of the **MuonClip optimizer**! It's successfully pushed **LLM** training scale to the **trillion-parameter level** and achieved amazingly stable training on a whopping **15.5 trillion** tokens. This seriously flips our traditional understanding of large-scale model training on its head! 😱 It also signals that the AI industry's technical review mechanisms are subtly evolving, as we're moving from the "B era" straight into a confident "T era"! 🚀['more details'](https://x.com/op7418/status/1943993841402753123)

3.  So good! 🤯 **Kimi K2** is showing off some seriously powerful **frontend generation capabilities**! It can not only perfectly handle complex page logic and animations, but it can even easily step in for the **Claude Code** model, offering a cost-effective development experience with no risk of account bans! 👍 This no doubt fills a gap for domestic **open-source models** in terms of **engineering practicality**, completely rebuilding developers' confidence in **homegrown large models**! 💪['more details'](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/687203b9e81ba2a179da0925)

4.  XinZhiYuan shared an awesome blog post, highly recommended by **Karpathy**, that hammers home a key point: **AI** is an **engineer's capability amplifier**, but how well it works ultimately boils down to an engineer's solid **coding skills**, precise **prompts**, and good **software engineering practices**. 💻 👨‍💻 The article breaks down how to cleverly leverage AI to supercharge development, debugging, learning, documentation generation, and code review efficiency. It also re-examines software engineering principles in the AI era, especially emphasizing that **testing** is non-negotiable! 🤔 This really throws a tough question at all engineers, doesn't it?! ['more details'](https://x.com/hongming731/status/1943857272964493417)

5.  In his latest YC talk, **Andrew Ng** sharply pointed out that the key to successful **AI era entrepreneurship** is **execution speed**! 🚀 He reckons that thanks to **AI coding assistance**, prototype development speed can go up by more than tenfold. This means the startup bottleneck isn't tech implementation anymore, but has shifted to **product management** and the **user feedback loop**! 🔄 He also particularly stressed that truly grasping **AI building blocks** (like agent workflows, RAG, fine-tuning) is central to building a competitive edge. At the same time, Ng also called on everyone to be wary of overhyped narratives about **AI** dangers and to actively protect the **open-source ecosystem**. Seriously insightful stuff! 💡['more details'](https://x.com/hongming731/status/1943856893124129024)
