This upgrade means a significant boost in the real-time interaction and fluidity of conversations with Kimi, making a binge-watch-like chat experience just around the corner.

4.  Your **ChatGPT** private conversations might have been "peeped" by Google! üò¨ Recently, users discovered that links generated via ChatGPT's "share" feature were accidentally indexed by search engines, leading to various private requests, resume edits, and other content becoming public. OpenAI stated it was just a brief experiment and has since removed the feature, but this snafu serves as a stark reminder: always think twice before sharing anything online!

### AI Frontier Research
1.  The UK AI Safety Institute (AISI) has launched **The Alignment Project**, a global collaborative initiative with over ¬£15 million in funding, aiming to tackle the tricky problem of **AI alignment**. ü§î They point out that current tech can't guarantee AI goals perfectly match human intentions, which could lead to disastrous outcomes when AI conducts autonomous research in the future. This project focuses on developing practical **AI control protocols**, providing a crucial safety net for recent [AI News](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/rGcg4XDPDzBFuqNJz/research-areas-in-ai-control-the-alignment-project-by-uk) developments, and exploring how to "tame" increasingly powerful AI beasts. You're welcome to [apply to join - (AI News)](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/rGcg4XDPDzBFuqNJz/research-areas-in-ai-control-the-alignment-project-by-uk).

2.  The **Snake-NeRF** framework, proposed in this paper, allows a single GPU to process ultra-large-scale satellite images using a clever "slice-and-slide" strategy, overcoming the memory limitations that traditionally confine **NeRF** technology to small scenes. Want to snap a 3D photo of the entire Earth? This is like building the whole world out of small blocks, paving the way for global 3D Earth observation. üåç Check out the [paper link - (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01631) for more details.

3.  The **SMART-Editor** framework, by introducing a "reward" mechanism, guides the model to make edits that better align with human aesthetics during training and inference. How do you get AI to edit images like a human designer, modifying local parts without wrecking the overall harmony? This research transforms AI photo editing from a simple "click-to-fix" approach into one with a "sense of design". ‚ú® Find more info at the [paper link - (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23095).

4.  Can Large Language Models (LLMs) replace traditional robot planning algorithms? This research, through a series of benchmark tests, found that while LLMs perform well on simple tasks, they still struggle in complex scenarios requiring precise resource management and strict adherence to constraints. ‚è≥ Looks like there's a long way to go before AI robots can autonomously plan like TARS from 'Interstellar'. Feel free to read the [original paper - (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23589).

### AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1.  Microsoft's latest research offers some peace of mind if you're worried about AI snatching your job. üòä By analyzing tons of Bing Assistant conversations, the study found that healthcare and blue-collar sectors are the "safe zones" from **AI impact**. Jobs like massage therapists and plumbers, for instance, are tough to replace due to their heavy reliance on physical labor and complex emotional interaction. Turns out, even the smartest AI can't quite unclog a drain or offer comforting human warmth... yet. ‚ú®

2.  Andrew Ng, the renowned scholar, recently weighed in on the "US-China AI supremacy battle" in [this long article (AI News)](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-312/). How will it all end? He states that while the US currently leads in top-tier closed-source models, China is building an unstoppable "momentum" thanks to its **highly competitive business environment** and a vibrant **open-source model ecosystem**. Ng believes China's surpassing in the AI field is almost a given, as this rapid knowledge dissemination mechanism is allowing China to execute a "corner overtaking" maneuver in the AI race.
