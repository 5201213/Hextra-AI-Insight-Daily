## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Stargazer"**
### Chapter 1: Eyes Beneath the Stars

#### 1. (Ancient Times)

The final thunderstorm of the rainy season, like a furious beast, clawed at the East African savanna sky.

Kli huddled in the deepest part of the cave, arms tightly wrapped around his knees. Unlike the other members of his tribe, he didn't emit low, comforting grunts between the thunderclaps, nor did he bury his face in his mother's warm fur like the youngsters, trembling with fear. He simply sat still, his body shivering slightly from cold and hunger, but his eyes remained wide open, staring at the chaotic, grayish-white world momentarily illuminated by lightning outside the cave entrance.

Each flash of lightning that tore across the sky cast the cave walls in relief, like the bones of some colossal beast. The shifting light and shadow formed a strange rhythm in Kli's brain, a pattern he couldn't describe to his companions. While others fearfully closed their eyes, taking the sky's wrath as some ineffable threat, Kli tried to understand it. He noticed that the brightest flashes of lightning were always followed by the loudest roars of thunder. Light, before sound. This discovery didn't bring him any practical benefit; it couldn't fill his stomach or warm his body, but it was like a smooth pebble, carefully tucked into a corner of Kli's consciousness.

The storm arrived quickly and departed just as fast. As the last dull rumble of thunder rolled towards the distant horizon, a stirring began in the cave. Gron, the leader, was the first to rise. He was powerfully built, covered in thick black fur, with an old scar running from the corner of his left eye down to his jaw, giving him a stern and fierce look. He let out a short, forceful roar ‚Äì the signal to "go foraging."

The tribe members responded, shaking their bodies, stretching stiff limbs, and grooming their damp fur. Hunger was the sole master now. Yesterday's downpour had kept them confined all day, and everyone's stomachs were empty.

Kli also stood, but unlike the others, he didn't immediately rush towards the entrance. His gaze swept past his companions' shoulders, seized by something outside the cave.

It was the sky.

The rain had washed all dust and restlessness from the air, leaving the sky an unprecedented, obsidian-deep color. And across this boundless black velvet, billions of diamond-like fragments were scattered. They weren't blindingly hot like the sun, nor did they have a distinct outline like the moon; they simply hung there quietly, some bright, some dim, some shining alone, others coalescing into a faint band of light, like a solidified silver river spanning the heavens.

Kli was frozen.

His feet felt bound by invisible vines, unable to take a single step. His brain, the very organ that had just separated lightning from thunder, was now utterly overwhelmed by this serene yet magnificent spectacle. This wasn't chaos, not a threat. He sensed an order, an order so grand it was breathtaking. The points of light weren't scattered randomly; there seemed to be a mysterious connection between them, one he couldn't yet decipher. He saw a few particularly bright stars forming a hooked shape, like the branch Gron used to extract grubs from tree hollows. Elsewhere, several stars linked together, resembling a running wildebeest.

This was a whole new language, one that transcended roars, gestures, and scents. It was immense, silent, yet it seemed to speak to him alone.

"Kli!"

Gron's roar struck Kli's consciousness like a stone thrown into a deep pool. The leader turned, glaring impatiently at the lingering young member. Kli's scrawny physique and behavior, out of sync with the rest of the tribe, had long displeased Gron. Now, with everyone eager to fill their bellies, Kli stood there like a dried branch, staring blankly at an empty sky.

Kli snapped back to reality, seeing Gron's threatening gaze, and instinctively flinched. He lowered his head and hurried to catch up with the group, but the starry sky was already etched into his mind like a brand. As he walked, he couldn't help but glance back, and each backward glance made his steps falter.

The foraging party fanned out across the savanna. Tribe members skillfully overturned rocks for lizards or probed ant nests with long fingers. Ona, a female slightly younger than Kli, nimbly climbed a baobab tree, picking the sparse fruits. She noticed Kli's distraction. He wasn't searching for tubers with distinctive scents as he usually did; instead, he stopped and started, his gaze constantly drifting above the ground.

Kli was trying to memorize the stars' positions. He discovered that as he walked east, the "silver river" seemed to slowly move as well. This was an astonishing revelation. It wasn't static! Like the sun and moon, it was "alive."

Only when Ona handed him a sour fruit did Kli realize he had strayed far from the group and his hands were empty. He numbly took the fruit, put it in his mouth, and chewed mechanically. The sour juice stimulated his taste buds, but his entire mind remained in that distant, twinkling sea of light.

In the evening, when the tribe returned to the cave with their meager findings, Gron tallied each member's contribution. When he reached Kli and saw only a few inedible grass roots at his feet, the leader's patience finally ran out.

He shoved Kli aside, announcing his punishment with an angry roar‚ÄîKli would get no food tonight. This was the tribe's harsh law of survival: no contribution, no food.

Kli didn't resist, nor did he show his usual fear. He simply retreated silently to a corner of the cave, the hunger in his stomach burning like fire in his gut. But strangely, another unprecedented "fullness" filled his mind. He closed his eyes, and the starry sky unfolded in his consciousness, more real than any food.

Deep into the night, the tribe passed their time chewing and sleeping. Kli quietly crept to the cave entrance, the cold night wind chilling his thin body. He looked up again, gazing at the profound night sky.

He saw that the "silver river" had moved to the other side of the sky. He saw that the "hook" had also changed its position. They were moving, in an incredibly slow but unmistakable way, rotating around an unseen center.

In that moment, the gnawing hunger in his belly, the cold in his body, the loneliness of being ostracized by the tribe‚Äîall seemed to fade into insignificance. A thought, a pure thought transcending survival instinct, arose for the first time in his muddled consciousness, like the first spark in darkness:

I wonder, will they still be there tomorrow night?

This was Kli's first question, a question unrelated to food, mates, or danger. This was a hominid, asking the universe a question for the very first time.

In his eyes, the entire starry sky was reflected.

#### 2. (Near Future, 1.5 Million Years Later)

"Dr. Lin, we should wrap up. Dust storm warning, it'll be here in two hours, tops."

Her assistant, Xiao Zhang, spoke with a hint of urgency through the walkie-talkie, crackling with static. Lin Yao didn't answer immediately. She knelt in a freshly cleared excavation unit, her dusting brush gently sweeping over a bone deeply embedded in the ochre soil. The setting sun stretched her shadow long across the East African Rift Valley, a land dubbed the "Cradle of Humanity."

"Give me ten more minutes," she murmured, her tone leaving no room for argument.

Her gaze was as focused as a high-precision scanner. The discovery of this fossil was purely accidental. During the last routine stratigraphic scan before quitting for the day, the ground-penetrating radar showed a density anomaly beneath this area. Everyone assumed it was just an ordinary rock, but only Lin Yao insisted on digging it out to see.

Now, a part of it was finally exposed. It wasn't rock; it was bone. More precisely, the top of a skull. Based on the volcanic ash layer it was found in, its age was at least 1.5 million years, belonging to an early Pleistocene Homo erectus, or even an earlier Homo habilis.

What captivated Lin Yao wasn't its age, but its morphology.

As a leading young scientist in paleoanthropological genetics and morphology, Lin Yao knew the evolution of human skulls over millions of years inside out. From the subtlest ridges and sulci, she could decipher the individual's species, approximate age, and even possible diet.

But this skull before her‚Äîsomething was off.

In the area corresponding to the human frontal lobe, the curvature of its parietal bone seemed slightly fuller than any known fossil from the same period. This expansion was minuscule, easily overlooked by anyone less acutely sensitive to data and form than Lin Yao. It didn't fit the known evolutionary models. In an era of extreme scarcity, the brain was a luxury organ, consuming vast amounts of energy. Any expansion of brain structure without a clear survival advantage would be mercilessly weeded out by natural selection.

And the frontal lobe‚Äîthat's where higher cognitive functions reside: planning, decision-making, abstract thought... What would a hominid from 1.5 million years ago need such an "advanced" frontal lobe for? To better craft stone tools? Or to calculate optimal routes when hunting antelopes? None of it seemed to add up.

"Dr. Lin, the wind's picking up!" Xiao Zhang's voice returned, this time with a plea.

"Got it," Lin Yao said, quickly standing. She directed the team to begin the initial stabilization and wrapping of the fossil using the most professional techniques, preparing to cut out the entire block of soil around it and transport it back to the camp lab. Her movements were swift and precise, but her mind was swirling.

By the time they returned to the makeshift lab tent, darkness had fully descended. Wind and sand began rattling against the thick canvas, making dull thuds. Inside the lab, lights blazed, and various precision instruments hummed quietly at their stations.

Lin Yao skipped water and immediately began CT scanning the block of soil encasing the fossil. On the computer screen, tomographic images built up layer by layer, finally forming a complete 3D model.

She zoomed in, rotating the ancient skull. When she compared the data to a standard Homo erectus skull model, the anomaly was clearly highlighted‚Äîthere was indeed an atypical volume increase of approximately 3% within the cranial cavity corresponding to the frontal lobe.

This was too weird. It was like finding a miniature gear crafted from precise alloys, not belonging to that era, inside an old steam locomotive. It shouldn't be there.

"Maybe it's just an individual developmental anomaly?" Xiao Zhang leaned over to look, offering a reasonable explanation.

"Possibly," Lin Yao nodded, but her gaze didn't leave the screen. "But anomalies usually come with functional impairments. And from the other parts of this skull, its owner lived successfully into adulthood; the parietal bone's suture lines are very clear. This suggests that this 'anomalous' structure, at least, didn't hinder his/her survival."

She mused, fingers unconsciously tapping on the cold metal table. Her thoughts branched out, shifting from morphology to her stronger field‚Äîancient DNA.

What if... what if even a tiny gene fragment related to brain development could be extracted from this fossil? Perhaps that would explain the mystery. It was an almost impossible task. 1.5 million years was enough time for most organic molecules to degrade into oblivion. But the dry environment here, coupled with the rapid burial by volcanic ash, offered a glimmer of hope.

"Xiao Zhang," Lin Yao suddenly said, "Prepare the cleanroom, Class A protection. I'm going to attempt a bone drilling sample from him/her."

Xiao Zhang paused, then understood Lin Yao's intention. "Doctor, that's too risky! What if the sample gets contaminated..."

"We don't have much time; the HQ transport plane will come for it after the dust storm," Lin Yao's eyes held an undeniable resolve. "I have a hunch there's something very important hidden in here. A story about our ancestors... one we've never seen before."

She put on her goggles and sterile gloves, stepping into the cleanroom built with white isolation membranes and a positive pressure system, like a surgeon about to perform an unprecedented operation. The laser drill emitted a faint hum, carefully probing downward at a specific point on the ancient skull.

Under the shadowless lamp's illumination, a light sparkled in Lin Yao's eyes‚Äîthe same light that gleamed in the eyes of the hominid gazing at the stars from the cave entrance 1.5 million years ago.

It was a pure craving for the unknown.

She didn't know that what she was about to drill into was not just a fossil, but a million-year-old secret connecting two timelines.
