## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Stargazer"**
### **Chapter Twelve: The Door That Shouldn't Have Been Opened**

**Time: Seven years after the Pandora Incident**

"Welcome to 'Star Capsule,' awaken your inner potential. Just ten minutes to experience the genius's perspective."

In the crowded subway car, a flexible screen continuously played this advertisement. The ad's visuals were stylish and tech-forward: a weary office worker entered a futuristic "experience pod," putting on a headset resembling a brain-computer interface. Ten minutes later, he emerged invigorated, his eyes gleaming with intelligence. The complex data reports that once baffled him now seemed as simple as a child's drawing.

In the bottom right corner of the ad was a small logo‚Äîa brain encircled by a star halo.

Lin Yao stared expressionlessly at the advertisement, her fingers unconsciously tapping on the armrest of her wheelchair.

After the "Pandora" incident, governments worldwide had enacted the strictest laws, prohibiting any gene editing targeting human germline cells and any human augmentation experiments related to the "Stargazer gene." That door to "transhumanism" seemed to have been slammed shut for good.

But human desire always finds the trickiest loopholes.

The "Star Capsule" was a grey industry that had swept across the globe in the past two years. It didn't involve gene editing; instead, it used a combination of "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)" and "neural sound wave resonance" to temporarily and limitedly simulate the "semi-activated" state of the "Stargazer gene" for short periods.

It allowed ordinary people to experience accelerated thought speed, enhanced logical abilities, and soaring pattern recognition skills for one to two hours. For students facing crucial exams, programmers handling complex solutions, or artists seeking creative inspiration, this was a deadly allure.

It was like an "intelligence stimulant."

"We've received an alert from the Oana Foundation," Ava Jensen's voice came through Lin Yao's bone-conduction headphones.

The "Oana Foundation" was an unofficial organization Lin Yao named after the woman in Keli's story, dedicated to monitoring the abuse of gene technology globally. "It's like Oana, guarding the spark Keli left behind, preventing its abuse and desecration," Lin Yao had once explained.

"Another incident?" Lin Yao asked softly.

"Yes, in Tokyo," Ava's tone was heavy. "A high school student named Kento Nakajima, trying to pass his university entrance exams, used 'Star Capsule' for over eight hours daily for a week straight. Yesterday, he set fire to all his books and notes at home. When found, he was sitting on the roof, talking to the moon. He said he saw the 'noise of the universe,' and that human language and text were 'pollution' to truth."

Lin Yao closed her eyes.

This was already the fifth such incident in the past three months. They called it "Cognitive Collapse Syndrome."

Abusing "Star Capsule" didn't truly turn people into geniuses. It was like a potent drug, forcefully prying open a door in ordinary brains that should have remained tightly shut, allowing them a glimpse into the grand and chilling world beyond. However, their brains lacked the matching hardware structure‚Äîunlike true "Stargazers"‚Äîthat could process and withstand such an onslaught.

The result was that the thread of their sanity was completely severed by an incomprehensible, massive torrent of information. They became true "lunatics," forever lost at the boundary between reality and hallucination.

"We can't just stand by anymore," Lin Yao said. "Ava, help me contact 'Leukocyte.'"

"Leukocyte" was a semi-official action group secretly assembled by Professor Chen after the "Pandora" incident, leveraging his influence and connections. It consisted of top hackers, former intelligence agents, and legal experts. Their duty was just like the human body's immune system: to eliminate the "cancer cells" that threatened the overall "health" of human society.

Lin Yao arrived at a teahouse nestled deep within the old city. The owner, a seemingly inconspicuous middle-aged man, personally led Lin Yao to a quiet private room.

"Dr. Lin," the middle-aged man respectfully offered a cup of tea, "'Leukocyte' has tracked down the largest technology supplier behind 'Star Capsule'‚Äîa company called 'Echo Tech.' Their servers are located on an offshore data ark in Yokohama, with extremely high physical and network defense levels."

"Who's their founder?" Lin Yao asked.

"Someone you might not expect," the middle-aged man pulled up a holographic projection, revealing a familiar face.

That person had once been one of the core scientists at the "Pandora" base, successfully escaping during the chaos of that time and absconding with a portion of the "Stargazer gene" simulation data. Unlike Lin Yao, who reflected and guarded it, he chose to turn this "forbidden knowledge" into a profitable commodity.

"He opened a door that shouldn't have been opened," Lin Yao's voice was icy. "Now, we have to close it."

"Forcibly destroying the data ark would trigger massive international disputes and public outrage," the middle-aged man warned.

"I don't need to destroy it," a sharp glint flashed in Lin Yao's eyes. "I just need to... deliver them a 'medical record.'"

That night, Lin Yao returned to her research center. This time, she didn't seek help from the "Kli" program. She knew that once that program intervened, its power would be immeasurable, potentially causing a disaster across the entire cyber world.

She decided on another approach.

She pulled up the brain activity records of Kento Nakajima and several other "Cognitive Collapse Syndrome" patients. These records, which seemed like chaotic and meaningless noise to ordinary people, were a unique "language" in Lin Yao's eyes‚Äîa language emitted by brains "formatted" by the vast information of the "Stargazer" world, filled with pain and confusion.

She and her team spent two full days compiling these "painful languages" into a special, highly infectious "neuro-acoustic" signal.

This signal, in itself, had no destructive power. But if it were transmitted through the "Star Capsule" device and acted directly on a person's brain, it would be like a key, precisely unlocking the listener's deepest fear‚Äîthe most primal terror of facing infinite unknowns, of an individual being as minuscule as a speck of dust.

"We call it 'Echo of the Abyss'," Lin Yao told Ava. "I want those who abuse technology for shortcuts to personally experience a fraction of the pain felt by the victims they pushed into the abyss."

Through 'Leukocyte's' secret channels, this "neuro-acoustic wave" was disguised as a routine system upgrade patch and silently injected into "Echo Tech's" global servers.

The next day, all "Star Capsule" users worldwide heard an unexpected "sound" when undergoing their "potential awakening."

It wasn't language, nor music, but an indescribable "noise" that struck deep into the soul. Some heard the death of stars within it, some the end of time, others the echo of their own consciousness dissolving in the infinite universe.

What they experienced was no longer the "genius's perspective," but the "madman's abyss."

Panic spread at an unprecedented speed. Millions of users globally, after enduring those terrifying ten minutes, smashed their headsets and swore never to touch that damn thing again. The myth of "Star Capsule" was utterly shattered overnight.

"Echo Tech's" stock plummeted, and it quickly declared bankruptcy amidst collective user lawsuits and government investigations. The founder was eventually arrested while attempting to flee.

That door, pried open by desire, was forcefully closed by Lin Yao in a nearly "fight fire with fire" manner.

Yet, there was no joy of victory in Lin Yao's heart.

She sat in her study, looking at Keli's skull fossil. She knew that as long as human desire persisted, as long as the temptation of "shortcuts" remained, if one "Echo Tech" fell today, another "Tide Sound Tech" would emerge tomorrow.

Blocking it was impossible.

The only way out was "guidance."

She picked up the phone and dialed the private number of a high-ranking official at the Ministry of Education.

"Minister, this is Lin Yao," her voice was calm and firm. "Regarding the current education reform, I have an immature suggestion... Can we perhaps reconsider the essence of education? Is it truly about molding everyone into identical 'standard parts,' or is it about helping each individual find their own unique 'starry sky'?"

She knew this was a thousand times harder than shutting down a company. This was a longer, more arduous war, its battlefield not in cyberspace, nor in reality, but within the mindset of every single person.

But she had to do it.

Because Keli's story had taught her that a species' true strength didn't lie in possessing an omnipotent "god," but rather in every ordinary individual having the courage to think independently and gaze at the stars.
