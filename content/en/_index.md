## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - 'The Stargazer'**
### **Chapter Two: The Other Side of the Stone**

#### **1. (Ancient Times)**

**Hunger** was a cold claw, repeatedly raking Kli's stomach.

**Kli**, stripped of his food allocation for a second day, left the cave earlier than anyone else. The sun was just painting a faint red blush on the horizon, and dew drops still clung to the tips of the long grass on the savanna. He had to find food, or he wouldn't survive the day.

**Other tribe members** set out in twos and threes, but no one invited Kli along. He had become an invisible shadow within the group. Even Ona, as she passed him, only cast a quick glance his way‚Äîa look mixed with pity and confusion‚Äîbefore hurrying to catch up with her mother.

**Kli** headed to the riverbed alone. It was strewn with round, smooth stones, polished by the water ‚Äì the tribe's most common tools, used for smashing nuts or breaking animal bones to suck out the marrow. He needed a good stone.

**Kli** crouched on the dry riverbed, rummaging through the pebbles scattered everywhere. His method of selection was unique. The tribe chose stones purely by weight and hardness. Kli, however, was studying their textures. He could see hidden, spiderweb-fine cracks within some stones. He seemed to 'foresee' where a stone would split when struck.

**This ability** had become clearer to him after he started gazing at the stars. Just as he could 'see' shapes from a chaotic scattering of stars, he could also 'see' a whole stone's future fragments.

**Kli** picked up a fist-sized piece of flint, hard and uniform in texture. Then, using another blunter stone, he aimed at a specific angle on the flint and struck hard.

‚ÄúCrack!‚Äù

**A crisp cracking sound** echoed. Instead of shattering into blunt chunks of varying sizes as usual, a thin, sharp flake detached from the flint. The edge of this flake gleamed coldly, like a beast's fangs.

**Kli** picked up the stone flake and carefully touched its edge with his finger. A tiny cut immediately appeared on his fingertip, and bright red blood beaded up. He paused, then an indescribable wave of excitement surged through him. He licked the tip, the metallic taste of blood mingling with the stone's coldness, stimulating his nerves.

**This thing** was sharper than any tooth or claw.

**Kli** effortlessly cut through a tough vine with the stone flake, then carved deep marks into a piece of dry wood. He could even use it to cut animal hides ‚Äì something the strongest males in the tribe struggled to do with their teeth.

**Kli** was lost in the joy of creation, forgetting his hunger. He struck repeatedly, and soon, a small pile of various stone flakes accumulated at his feet. Some were long and pointed, like spearheads; others wide and thin, like scrapers. They were no longer products of nature but things given new forms and uses through his 'foreseeing' and his hands. They were Kli's creations.

**When Ona found him**, Kli was intently sharpening the end of a wooden stick with a sharp stone flake. Wood shavings fell away, and the once blunt stick gradually revealed a dangerous, rudimentary shape.

**Ona** quietly approached, curiously watching the 'toy' in Kli's hands. She saw the odd-shaped stones at his feet and his finger, almost stained red with blood. She didn't understand what Kli was doing, but she could sense that these things were utterly different from the tribe's clumsy smashing stones.

**She** let out a soft, questioning gurgle.

**Kli** looked up and saw Ona. In her eyes, he didn't see the disgust and wariness he often saw from Grong, only pure curiosity. It was a long-lost feeling of being 'seen.' He hesitated, then handed her the sharpest flake he held, pointing with his other finger to a thick-skinned plant nearby.

**Ona**, mimicking him, gently cut with the flake. The tough plant skin split silently, like butter melting under a hot knife. Ona's eyes widened in surprise. She looked down at the flake in her hand, then back at Kli, her gaze filled with disbelief.

**She** wanted one too. Clumsily, she picked up two stones and knocked them together, only getting a pile of useless fragments and nearly smashing her own foot.

**Kli** watched her and suddenly understood something profound. This 'knowledge' ‚Äì how to choose a stone, where to strike it ‚Äì existed only within his own mind. He couldn't 'teach' her with roars or gestures. This chasm was more profound than his physical distance from the tribe.

**Just then, Grong**, the leader, appeared with several strong males. They'd had a good haul today, carrying the carcass of a small gazelle. When Grong spotted the pile of 'useless' fragments at Kli's feet and the sharpened stick in his hand, his brow furrowed instantly.

**A male grumbled** gutturally, pointing at the flakes, 'He's wasting his time. Can those things even crack a bone?'

**Grong** strode over to Kli, picked up a large, round smashing stone from the ground, and cast a disdainful look at the light flake in Kli's hand. He struck a cow bone hard with the smashing stone, and it cracked instantly, revealing the rich marrow inside. This was a display of strength, the only effective method recognized by the tribe.

**Then, he** kicked apart the pile of stone tools Kli had painstakingly crafted. The sharp flakes scattered, making a clinking sound. Grong grabbed Kli's sharpened stick, easily snapped it in half, and threw it to the ground.

**'Go find food!' Grong** roared a warning at Kli. He couldn't tolerate such 'useless' and 'bizarre' behavior spreading within his tribe. He believed Kli was destroying useful, whole stones to make some flashy trifles. This was a threat, jeopardizing the tribe's ancient and effective way of life.

**Kli** silently watched his ruined 'creations.' He felt no anger, no sadness, only a deeper, chilling sense of loneliness. He looked at Grong and the males behind him‚Äîstrong, efficient, perfectly adapted to this world. And himself, along with the ideas in his head about the 'other side' of stars and stones, were utterly worthless in this world.

**He** silently turned and walked away. Behind him, Ona quietly picked up a sharp flake that Grong had missed from the dirt, quickly hiding it in her palm.

#### **2. (Near Future)**

**'A miracle**... This is nothing short of a miracle in genetic archaeology.'"

**Professor Chen** adjusted his reading glasses, his eyes practically glued to the holographic projection of the gene sequence map. His graying hair was disheveled, and his face was a mix of excitement and disbelief. As Lin Yao's mentor and a leading authority in China's gene field, he had flown overnight from the capital to this temporary lab on the East African front line.

**Before them**, a DNA double helix, magnified billions of times by the computer, slowly rotated. A segment of it was highlighted ‚Äì precisely the gene fragment Lin Yao's team had successfully extracted and restored from that skull fossil.

**Lin Yao** whispered the name she had given it: 'G-Stargazer-01 prototype...' 'Professor Chen, look, its structure has partial homology with the modern human 'FOXP2' gene cluster, but there are fundamental differences. It doesn't govern language; it's more like... a pattern processor.'"

**'Exactly,' Professor Chen** picked up the conversation, his finger swiping through the air to pull up another set of data. 'Its encoded protein, in theory, would greatly enhance the synaptic connection density and efficiency between neurons in the cerebral cortex, especially in the frontal lobe. For anyone possessing it, the brain's capacity to process abstract information, recognize complex patterns, and engage in long-term planning would be elevated to an... unimaginable degree.'"

**Lin Yao** posed the question that had bothered her all night: 'For an ancient human from 1.5 million years ago, possessing this ability‚Äîwould it be a blessing or a curse?'"

**Professor Chen** fell silent. He took off his glasses and rubbed his tired eyes. 'In that primitive age, such a 'gift' was likely a curse. When your peers were only concerned with where their next meal was coming from, you were pondering why the stars rose and fell. The world you saw was completely different from theirs; how would you communicate with them? In a group, individuals who cannot be understood typically face only two fates: deification, or being treated as an outsider and a threat, and then eliminated.'"

**His words** made Lin Yao's heart tremble. She felt as though she saw that lonely soul who lived a million years ago.

**'We must publish this discovery,' Lin Yao** said firmly. 'This is a discovery that could rewrite human evolutionary history.'"

**Professor Chen's expression** turned serious. 'I agree. But be cautious, Xiaoyao. I've already sent the preliminary paper abstract to a few top journal editors I know, all through encrypted channels. Before formal publication, absolutely no one else can know the details, especially the functional speculation of this gene.'"

‚ÄúAre you worried‚Ä¶?‚Äù

**Professor Chen sighed**, 'I'm worried about the businessmen, not the scientists. You know, Prometheus Bio-Tech has been researching 'intelligence genes.' They claim it's for treating Alzheimer's, but everyone knows their true objective. If they found out there's a natural 'super gene' that can massively boost cognitive abilities, what do you think they'd do?'"

**Lin Yao's face** darkened. Prometheus Bio-Tech was a global behemoth in biotechnology, notorious for its aggressive, even ethics-disregarding, research style. Their CEO, Marcus Thorne, was an ambitious individual who openly advocated for transhumanism.

**Just as they were discussing**, the lab door was knocked. Xiao Zhang poked his head in, a strange look on his face. 'Dr. Lin, Professor Chen, outside... there's a visitor, he says his name is Marcus Thorne.'"

**Lin Yao and Professor Chen** exchanged a glance, both seeing shock in the other's eyes.

That fast?

**Marcus Thorne** stood just outside the tent, looking as if he wasn't visiting a remote archaeological camp but attending a high-end gala. He wore a tailored linen suit, his golden hair impeccably styled, and a gentle yet confident smile graced his face. Behind him, two VTOL aircraft bearing the Prometheus Corp logo hovered silently nearby, kicking up plumes of dust.

**Marcus** extended his hand, his voice magnetic and instantly drawing you in: 'Dr. Lin, I've long admired your reputation. Your work is truly revealing humanity's deepest secrets for all of us.'"

**Lin Yao** shook his hand, feeling his grip was warm and firm. 'Mr. Thorne, I never expected to see you here. What brings such a distinguished guest to our humble camp?'"

**'The wind of wisdom, of course,' Marcus** chuckled, his gaze drifting over Lin Yao's shoulder to casually glance inside the lab. 'I happened to chance upon the abstract of your forthcoming paper through a friend. A gene linked to a cognitive leap in ancient humans... I must admit, it's the most exciting concept I've encountered in years. I'm here, on behalf of Prometheus Corp, to seek a collaboration.'"

**Lin Yao and Professor Chen's hearts** sank. A 'friend'? Had a journal editor leaked the info, or were their communications intercepted? Either way, their worst fears had come true. The information barrier had been easily breached in the face of Prometheus Corp's formidable financial and technical power.

**'Collaboration?' Professor Chen** stepped forward, placing himself between Lin Yao and Marcus, his tone neither humble nor arrogant. 'Mr. Thorne, our research is still in a very preliminary stage; everything is merely theoretical speculation.'"

**'I understand,' Marcus** smiled, his gaze turning to Lin Yao, sharp as a scalpel. 'But theory is a seed, and Prometheus Corp has the best soil in the world to grow it into a towering tree. Dr. Lin, imagine: unlimited research funds, top-tier equipment. We could even build you a one-of-a-kind ancient gene research institute on a private island in the South Pacific. You just focus on your research, and we'll handle everything else.'"

**This was an irresistible offer**. Lin Yao knew that on their own, she and Professor Chen might need a decade or even longer to fully crack the secret of the 'Stargazer Gene.' Prometheus Corp, however, could shorten that timeline to a single year.

**But she also knew** that Marcus wanted far more than just an academic paper. He wanted the key to unlocking human potential, and he wanted it under his control.

**Lin Yao** looked at Marcus's sincere and enthusiastic face and, for the first time, profoundly experienced the oppressive weight of 'information asymmetry.' Marcus clearly knew things she and Professor Chen didn't ‚Äì perhaps more about the gene itself, or how to harness it. He wasn't here today to negotiate; he was here to harvest.

**'Mr. Thorne,' Lin Yao** took a deep breath, a professional smile gracing her face. 'Your proposal is very tempting. My mentor and I will need some time to consider it. After all, this is a major decision.'"

**'Of course,' Marcus** seemed not at all surprised by her answer. 'I'll be waiting for you in Nairobi for three days. I look forward to jointly ushering in a new chapter for humanity with you and your magnificent discovery.'"

**After speaking, he** elegantly turned and boarded the aircraft. With a roar of engines, the two VTOLs rose from the ground and quickly vanished into the twilight sky.

**The lab** fell into a long silence.

**'He isn't guessing,' Professor Chen's voice** was hoarse. 'He's almost certain this gene is real and effective. Xiaoyao, he knows more than we do.'"

**Lin Yao** said nothing. She walked over to the block of earth encasing the fossil, gently placing her hand on it, as if she could feel the coldness from a million years ago.

**She** wondered: what did that ancient human, blessed with the 'Stargazer Gene,' see? What did he experience? What was his ultimate fate?

**And now, a 'Grong' from the future** was trying to snatch away the only legacy he had left to this world.

**The chasm between her and that ancient soul**, in this moment, seemed replaced by another, more real and dangerous chasm. She had to make a choice. And every choice led to an unknown future, fraught with immense risks.
