### AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  Pony.ai (Luobo Kuaipao) and other companies just scored Shanghai's **autonomous driving demonstration operational licenses**, meaning your next ride-hailing car on Shanghai streets might not have a driver! üõ£Ô∏è This marks a new commercial phase for autonomous driving, moving from "road testing" to "picking up passengers." Soon, hailing an **L4 autonomous vehicle** in Pudong's core area will be a reality. Future mobility is within reach, and this AI news gives us a clear glimpse of what's coming.

2.  China's "national team" in AI is officially assembled! üí™ The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) just launched the **"Innovation Hub" AI open-source platform**. Its goal is crystal clear and firm: to bring together the entire industry chain to build a domestic AI innovation powerhouse, integrating **computing power, models, and data**. This platform aims for collaborative action to create our own AI ecosystem, free from external constraints. This is a truly strategic move among all the AI news updates.

3.  A **Nature article** just dropped a warning: "**Writing is thinking**." üß† Are we outsourcing our cognitive abilities under the AIGC wave? If we completely hand over the process of organizing logic and sparking new ideas to large language models, we might lose the chance for deep reflection. What we end up reading could just be AI's "hallucinations," prompting some serious soul-searching within the AI news community about the future.
