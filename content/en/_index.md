5.  AI News: The REST framework is here because current evaluation methods for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are totally "old-school." They just test one question at a time, letting models easily "cheat" their way through or completely failing to measure their true capabilities in complex, multi-task scenarios. Researchers cooked up this "boot camp" ‚Äì the REST framework ‚Äì specifically to stress-test LRMs. üß™ It can throw multiple problems at once, simulating real-world AI scenarios where they have to "multitask," making it a significant stride in AI news.

6.  The test results of REST are absolutely jaw-dropping: even top-tier models claiming SOTA, like DeepSeek-R1, took a massive nosedive in performance under REST's "interrogation," basically a huge "train wreck"! üí• This shows that REST is much better at "seeing through" and revealing the real differences between models than traditional benchmarks. The research also pinpointed AI's "overthinking trap" as the main culprit for performance drops, while models trained with "long2short" technology showed much stronger "stress resistance." Looks like REST can not only help us truly assess AI but also point the way for future AI R&D, saving us from throwing money at manually labeling "ineffective problems." This is seriously big AI news! üí° [AI News: REST Framework Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10541)
