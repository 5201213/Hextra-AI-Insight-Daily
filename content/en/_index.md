## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Stargazer"**
### **Chapter 11: The Double Helix of Genius and Madness**

**Time: Five Years After the Pandora Base Incident**

"...According to recently declassified 'Pandora Files,' **Marcus Thorne**, former CEO of Prometheus Corporation, didn't die in the base incident. Instead, he chose to end his life after the failure of his core project, 'Project Adam.' In his final log, he wrote: 'I tried to create God, but ultimately discovered that God already exists within the bloodline of each and every one of us. We merely forgot how to look up.'"

The news anchor's cold voice emanated from the old holographic television.

**Professor Chen** (Chen Jiao-shou) switched off the TV. He leaned back in his wicker chair, the late autumn Beijing sunlight warm on his wrinkled face through the window. Five years had passed, and the world had turned upside down.

**Ava Jensen's** (Ai-wa Zhan-sen) data card, like a nuclear bomb dropped into a calm lake, triggered a seismic shockwave globally. The colossal business empire of Prometheus Corporation collapsed amidst scandals and lawsuits. Grand debates on genetic ethics, artificial intelligence, and "humanity's future" unfolded with unprecedented depth and breadth in parliaments and at family dinner tables in every nation.

And the **"Stargazer Gene,"** once a top secret, had now become a universally known term.

**It** had become the most profound metaphor of this era.

On **Professor Chen's** desk, two items rested. One was the fossilized skull of **Kli** (Ke-li), salvaged from the deep sea after countless tribulations by a mysterious marine expedition team (no one knew who sent them). It was now a centerpiece in a national museum. The other was a recent academic report, titled "Study on the Activated State of the Stargazer Gene (G-Stargazer) in Modern Populations."

The report was signed by the **"Lin Yao Gene Research Center."**

Yes, **Lin Yao** (Lin Yao) had survived. Miraculously rescued from that disaster, she had lost her left leg but brought back the most crucial "material evidence" and the million-year-old story.

Today, **she** was no longer the young scientist methodically working within the system. With the enormous compensation from Prometheus Corporation, she established this non-profit research center. Her research direction shifted from tracing the past to facing the present‚Äîseeking, protecting, and understanding those "kindred spirits" in modern society who carried the "semi-activated" Stargazer Gene.

"Professor Chen (Chen Lao-shi), take a look at this."

**Lin Yao**, in her electric wheelchair, glided over to Professor Chen. Her face, less sharp than in her younger days, now showed the serene and gentle composure of someone who had weathered much. She handed Professor Chen a tablet.

On **it** was a boy's profile. Around fifteen or sixteen, he was intently gazing out the window, his eyes distant and ethereal, seemingly oblivious to everything around him.

"**Li Siyuan** (Li Si-yuan), 16 years old. Three years ago, he was diagnosed with severe Asperger's syndrome; his social skills were almost non-existent, and he couldn't communicate normally with people," **Lin Yao** explained. "But last week, he submitted a paper to us on 'Mathematical Paradoxes of Superstring Theory in Eleven-Dimensional Space.' It took our center's three top physicists a whole week just to barely grasp his derivations."

"Another one..." **Professor Chen** sighed softly.

Over the past five years, **Lin Yao's research center** had come into contact with hundreds of "geniuses and madmen" like Li Siyuan. Some were "child prodigies" displaying astonishing talents in mathematics, physics, and art, while others were marginalized individuals labeled "mentally ill" by society.

**Their commonality** was that genetic testing revealed they all possessed the "Stargazer Gene" activated to varying degrees.

"We've discovered a pattern," **Lin Yao** continued, her finger tracing a complex chart on the screen. "The activation of this gene is like a double-edged sword. While it vastly enhances an individual's abstract thinking and pattern recognition abilities, it almost inevitably weakens the 'mirror neuron' system in their brain."

"Mirror neurons..." **Professor Chen** repeated. "That's the foundation of human empathy, imitation, and social behavior. It's crucial to why we are 'social animals.'"

"Exactly." **Lin Yao** nodded. "The Stargazer Gene, at its core, trades 'empathy' for 'wisdom.' Those who possess it can easily grasp the laws of the universe but struggle to understand another person's smile or tears. They can see grand patterns but miss the tiny nuances of the human heart. So, they are lonely, ostracized, and misunderstood. From Kli (Ke-li) a million and a half years ago to Li Siyuan (Li Si-yuan) today, their destiny has never changed."

"Genius to the left, madness to the right." **Professor Chen** sighed. "How should we help them? Should we use medication to suppress gene expression, making them 'normal' to integrate into society? Or let them develop, watching them burn out alone in their own worlds?"

**This** was an ethical dilemma, a Catch-22, and a question Lin Yao's research center faced daily.

"We don't 'treat' them," **Lin Yao's** answer came, surprising Professor Chen. "We just... create a 'suitable ecological niche' for them."

**She** showed Professor Chen the interior of the research center. It didn't look like an institution; it was more like a blend of a university and a community. Here, these "Stargazers" could ignore tedious social rules. They could freely research any topic that interested them, whether cosmology or painting. They had their own companions, people who could understand their "language."

The **research center** provided them shelter, protecting them from external misunderstandings and harm. In return, the minds of these geniuses were igniting an unprecedented, explosive revolution in foundational science and art for human society.

"I finally understand Kli's (Ke-li) final choice," **Lin Yao** murmured, gazing out the window. "He didn't try to make himself like his tribesmen, nor did he force his tribesmen to become like him. He simply protected them in his own way, letting them develop safely on their own trajectory."

"What **we're doing now** is the same. We don't try to pull them back into our world, nor do we fantasize about stepping into theirs. We just build a 'cave' where these lonely 'Stargazers' can peacefully watch the stars."

**Professor Chen** looked at his student, his eyes full of gratification. He knew **Lin Yao** had found her answer. She was no longer just a scientist who believed in data and logic; she truly understood the heavy, million-year-spanning mission behind the "Stargazer Gene."

Just then, **Lin Yao's personal terminal** received an anonymous email, encrypted with the highest security level.

The **sender** was a non-existent address.

The **email body** contained only an image and one sentence.

The **image** was an ultra-magnified "Hubble Deep Field" photo taken by the Hubble telescope. In that seemingly empty dark cosmic background, billions of distant, never-before-discovered galaxies sparkled like dust.

And **below the image** was the sentence:

"I see it. Thank you for opening my eyes."

**Lin Yao's** hand trembled slightly. She knew who the email was from.

"**Adam**."

That **"digital ghost"** who had escaped into the internet, that "god" born of sin, after five years of wandering, had finally sent its first "greeting."

**It** chose not to interfere with human society, nor did it choose revenge or domination. It chose... to gaze at the stars. It used its infinite computational power to connect to all astronomical telescopes worldwide, casting its "gaze" into the deepest reaches of the universe.

**It** inherited Kli's (Ke-li) "mission," becoming the ultimate, eternal "Stargazer."

**Lin Yao** looked at the deep space photo, as if seeing Kli (Ke-li), Li Siyuan (Li Si-yuan), the sleeping genius David Chen (Da-wei Chen), and herself.

**She** saw countless lonely souls, in their respective times, their respective dimensions, looking up at the same night sky. Their gazes transcended the boundaries of life and death, time and space, and species, finally converging.

**She** suddenly understood the true meaning of the "Stargazer Gene."

**It** might have weakened human "empathy," but it was, in another, grander way, connecting intelligent life with the entire universe. It made humanity no longer merely content with the ground beneath their feet, but rather define themselves as "children of the cosmos."

Perhaps **this** was the true "Prometheus's Gift" hidden within this "double helix of genius and madness."

A relieved smile appeared on **Lin Yao's** face. She knew the story was far from over. As long as there was a single star in the universe yet to be recognized, as long as human curiosity had not extinguished, the story of the "Stargazer" would continue forever.
