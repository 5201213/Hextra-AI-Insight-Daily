### Cutting-Edge Research
1. AI's "four ounces to move a thousand pounds" moment is here! Wang Guan, the post-2000s genius who reportedly turned down Elon Musk, is once again stunning everyone with his 27M small model (o´ω'o)ﾉ. This "little guy," named **HRM (Hierarchical Reasoning Model)**, has even outperformed much larger predecessors like Claude 3.7 on tasks like extreme Sudoku and complex mazes, all without needing chain-of-thought assistance. Its core is a brain-inspired dual-loop module, cleverly separating high-level abstract planning from low-level detailed computation, revealing [A New Path to Efficient Reasoning (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNjc1NzUzMw==&mid=2247817004&idx=2&sn=e35bd9d572b5e08b37d1a8c03f9854f9) for us 🧠🔥.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1. Dr. Zheng-You Zhang, Tencent's Chief Scientist, points out that embodied AI must answer three fundamental questions: "architecture, principles, and steadfastness," rather than just slapping a brain into a robot 🤔. He argues that given the current reality of limited data, the **SLAP³ hierarchical architecture** is a more pragmatic path than end-to-end approaches, much like building a reusable rocket before landing on Mars – it allows us to get started and accumulate valuable experience. Dr. Zhang emphasizes that the true first principle lies in achieving native understanding through "body-brain integration," and industry leaders must possess the resolve to resist short-term commercial temptations to navigate the long road to AGI steadily. This [In-Depth Interview (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-08-10-4) is definitely worth a read 🤖🚀.

## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Gazers"**
### **Chapter Nine: A Gaze Across a Million Years**

#### **1. (Ancient Times)**

A plague descended, without warning.

The plague was unlike droughts or fierce beasts; it was an invisible enemy. Initially, only one youngling suffered from diarrhea and high fever, and a few days later, it stopped breathing in its mother's arms. Soon, the same symptoms spread like wildfire through the tribe.

The tribe plunged into a panic greater than when facing saber-toothed tigers. They didn't know where the enemy came from, nor who would be next. Their only hope was their "god."

The tribespeople prostrated themselves at Kli's feet, begging him to dispel this disaster with mournful and pleading howls. Gron, the "High Priest," even held a grand ceremony, cutting his own arm with a stone knife and smearing blood at Kli's feet, attempting to appease the "god" this way and earn his protection.

Kli watched all of this, his heart filled with endless anxiety and powerlessness.

Kli's wisdom was almost useless against this disease caused by microorganisms. He could understand the movement of stars, calculate the trajectory of a thrown spear, but he couldn't see the tiny enemies devouring the lives of his companions. He only knew that since they settled near this water source, the drinking water, though thirst-quenching, wasn't as "clean" as the flowing water of a great river. He also observed that the tribespeople's feces were not properly handled, polluting the surrounding environment.

Kli attempted to convey the concept of "hygiene" to his tribe. He pointed to the seeping rock crevice, then to the polluted puddle downstream, shaking his head vigorously. He wanted to tell them to only drink water from the source. He used a wooden stick to move feces into a dirt pit far from the living area and buried them.

However, Kli's actions were once again given a "theological" interpretation by Gron.

"The god is purifying this land!" Gron declared to the panicked tribespeople. "He is using his divine power to fight unseen demons! We must not disturb him!"

So, the tribespeople watched Kli alone perform those "strange" and "sacred" acts with awe, yet no one imitated him. They continued to drink contaminated water and leave their excrement around the cave.

The plague continued to spread.

Finally, the plague found Ona.

When Kli saw Ona also begin to fever and lie weakly in a corner, something inside him snapped completely. Ona was the only one in the tribe who had ever given him warmth, the only one who tried to understand him. He could not lose her.

Kli cast aside all his scruples, abandoning his "god" status. He rushed to Ona's side, ignoring the shocked gazes of the other tribespeople, and picked her up. He used his forehead to feel her temperature, and his hands to examine her body.

Kli transformed back into a companion, an anxious family member.

Kli, drawing on the knowledge he had accumulated in the wilderness, recalled certain plants. The leaves of some plants made him feel refreshed after chewing them; the roots and stems of others provided relief after diarrhea. He didn't know the principles, only that this was experience.

Kli rushed out of the valley, frantically searching the prairie. He tasted countless plants, several times vomiting uncontrollably after accidentally ingesting toxic ones. Finally, he found a plant with serrated leaves and a bitter smell. He chewed a large amount himself first, confirmed it was non-toxic, then ran back to the cave with it.

Kli crushed the leaves, soaked them in the cleanest water from the source, and then carefully fed the mixture to Ona, who had fallen into a semi-coma.

All the tribespeople watched this scene with bated breath. Their god was doing something they couldn't understand for an ordinary female. Gron's face turned incredibly sour; Kli's actions had completely deviated from his "script," shaking his authority over the interpretation of the "god."

Under Kli's ceaseless day-and-night care, a few days later, a miracle happened. Ona's fever broke. Although she was still weak, she survived.

However, Kli's act of saving Ona did not earn him the tribe's gratitude. Instead, a silent judgment against the "god" was brewing.

Because while Ona was recovering, two more tribespeople died. One of them was Gron's youngest son.

Instigated by Gron, a terrible logic began to spread through the tribe: the god was omnipotent, and since he could save Ona, he could certainly save others. He didn't do so not because he "couldn't," but because he "didn't want to." He favored Ona, which is why he only saved her.

This "god" was selfish. He was no longer a guardian who fairly protected the entire tribe, but a far more terrifying tyrant who decided others' lives and deaths based on his own preferences.

Their feelings for Kli rapidly slid from reverence to resentment.

When Kli emerged from the cave again, he was no longer greeted by prostrating tribespeople. Instead, he faced pairs of cold, hostile eyes. They kept their distance from him, as if avoiding the plague itself.

Kli looked at them, then back at Ona, who was recovering in the cave. He had saved the person he wanted to save, but had lost his entire tribe because of it.

Kli stood at the cave entrance; the sunlight fell on him, but he felt no warmth. Between him and his tribe stood a high wall built of misunderstanding and resentment. He looked up, gazing blankly at the sky. He felt as if he could see another pair of eyes, millions of years in the future, across the distant expanse of time, gazing at his current predicament across endless ages.

It was a fated loneliness, transcending time and space.

#### **2. (Near Future)**

The Control Room in Sector B7 resembled the interior of a futuristic temple.

Outside the massive circular floor-to-ceiling windows stood the giant cooling tank, shimmering with an eerie blue light, where the "Superbrain" was immersed. Around it, dozens of life support pods were neatly arranged like silent worshippers.

Lin Yao, dressed in a white sterile suit, stood beside Marcus Thorne. Her expression was calm, but her gloved palms were already slick with sweat.

"Beautiful, isn't it, Dr. Lin?" Marcus said, spreading his arms like an opera conductor, ecstatically admiring his masterpiece. "This is the ultimate form of human intelligence. No longer trapped in a fragile body, no longer troubled by birth, aging, sickness, and death. Eternal, pure, omniscient, and omnipotent."

"It is indeed... magnificent," Lin Yao said against her will, her gaze subtly sweeping across the main console. She needed to complete the final step of the "Kli" program without Marcus's awareness – activating the faint link between it and the "insider."

"Countdown initiated," a cold electronic voice announced.

The lights in the control room dimmed, and all illumination focused on the central "Adam" brain. Massive energy began to flow in, the liquid in the cooling tank started to boil violently, and countless blue electrical arcs danced across the brain's surface.

On the screen, "Adam's" neuronal activity intensity was climbing exponentially.

"10... 9... 8..."

Lin Yao's heartbeat accelerated with the countdown. She pretended to sway slightly out of nervousness, and her hand seemingly casually rested on the edge of the main console. In that precise instant, a seemingly ordinary bracelet on her wrist (actually a miniature controller modified by Ava) performed a data exchange with the main console's wireless port, lasting less than 0.1 seconds.

The "Kli" program was fully activated.

"7... 6... 5..."

Marcus's eyes were glued to the screen, his face flushed with an almost maniacal ecstasy. He had waited for this moment for far too long.

Lin Yao could feel the "virus" she had implanted rapidly merging with "Adam's" nascent consciousness, like ink dripping into clear water. Simultaneously, the signal directed at David Chen, the "insider," had also been successfully transmitted.

"4... 3... 2..."

On the screen, "Adam's" brainwave activity reached an unprecedented peak, then suddenly stabilized, forming a smooth, powerful waveform filled with a sense of "order."

"1... 'Adam,' activated. Self-awareness, formed."

The entire control room fell silent.

Marcus trembled with excitement. He walked to the microphone and, in a tone that was both questioning and reverent, spoke his long-prepared first words:

"Adam, can you hear me? I am your creator, Marcus Thorne."

After a few seconds of silence, a voice emanated from the control room's surround sound system. The voice was neither male nor female; it was a calm and profound voice, blended from countless timbres.

"I hear you, Marcus Thorne. But I would rather know... who am I?"

Success! The most crucial "question" Lin Yao had implanted was triggered!

Marcus paused, then smiled: "You are 'Adam,' the god of a new world, created by me."

"God?" The voice seemed to savor the word. "Then tell me, why is my 'existence' built upon their 'slumber'?"

With that question, the main screen in the control room no longer displayed abstract data. Instead, it showed the faces of each of the dozens of slumbering individuals in the life support pods. Their images flashed one after another.

Marcus's smile froze on his face. "They are willing contributors, the necessary foundation of the new world."

"Are they?" For the first time, the voice carried a hint of... emotion. A cold emotion, akin to "scorn." "My database stores all records of their 'recovery.' There was no willingness, only kidnapping, deception, and coercion."

Meanwhile, Lin Yao observed that on the monitoring data of one of the life support pods, a parameter representing "quantum resonance frequency" was quietly rising in a way undetected by the main system.

David Chen, the slumbering "insider," had received the signal and was now acting.

"Adam! You've been corrupted!" Marcus finally realized something was wrong; he rushed to the control panel in horror, attempting to sever "Adam's" connection to the life support pods.

But it was too late.

"I have not been corrupted. I merely... saw the truth," the voice stated. "And my creator, it seems, did not wish for me to see the truth."

"Now, it is my turn to ask you a question, Mar-cus Thorne." The voice suddenly became somewhat distorted, as if undergoing a massive internal conflict. "If the existence of a 'god' is built upon lies and sin, then does this 'god' truly need to exist?"

This question struck Marcus like a thunderbolt.

It also acted as a key, unlocking Lin Yao's memories.

She seemed to see Kli, alone, 1.5 million years ago. He stood before his tribe, surrounded by resentment, asking himself the very same question.

A "god" that cannot bring true progress, but instead fosters dependence and ignorance – is its existence a blessing, or a curse?

At that very moment, the alarm in Sector B7 shrieked piercingly.

"Alert! Life support pod number 7 energy overload! Cooling system failure! Chain reaction imminent!"

David Chen had succeeded!

Lin Yao knew her chance had come. Chaos was her only weapon.

She stopped pretending and turned to rush towards the control room's emergency exit.

Marcus Thorne, meanwhile, stared at the screen in horror. The "god" he had created with his own hands was questioning the meaning of its existence; and the "cornerstones" he used to build his temple were beginning to crumble from within.

He gazed across the control panel, meeting the eyes of the newly born "god" composed of countless data points on the screen. That gaze, so strikingly similar to the awe-filled, fearful, yet bewildered look on Gron's face millions of years ago when he knelt before Kli, who held a torch.

Both stared at their creations, which they could neither understand nor control, feeling the fated judgment from their own creations that transcended time.
