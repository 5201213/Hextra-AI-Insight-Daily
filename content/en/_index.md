### **AI Product and Feature Updates**

1.  Recently, **WeChat Pay** rolled out its innovative **MCP** feature, which is seriously like a "highway" for AI applications to rake in the dough! 🚀 It lets AI complete payments right while interacting with users. Not only does this massively simplify the payment process and boost conversion rates, but it also smartly creates a closed data loop. This means AI can adjust its services in real-time, even turning income into data to fuel **self-learning** and expand AI business models. Talk about killing multiple birds with one stone! 💡

2.  **Meta** is secretly testing a "more proactive" **chatbot** 🤖 on its popular apps, **Facebook Messenger** and **WhatsApp**. These bots are so smart they can remember your preferences and even "strike up a conversation" with you! 🤔 While this move could definitely deepen user-AI interaction and bring in some serious cash, let's not forget to keep an eye on the potential **security risks**! ⚠️

### **AI Cutting-Edge Research**

1.  German AI consulting firm TNG has unleashed a "wildly impressive" AI model – **DeepSeek R1T2 Chimera** 🧪! By cleverly merging three big models—DeepSeek V3, R1, and R1-0528—and using a super cool "**Assembly of Experts (AoE) technique**," it's actually faster and more powerful than the official R1! 🔥 This **open-source model**, with weights available on Hugging Face, is set to find the **perfect balance** between speed, intelligence, and output efficiency. So much to look forward to! 🚀 For more details, check out the ['model address'](https://huggingface.co/tngtech/DeepSeek-TNG-R1T2-Chimera) and ['paper address'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14794).

### **AI Industry Outlook and Social Impact**

1.  The CEO of **Hitachi Energy**, the world's largest transformer manufacturer, has sounded the alarm ⚠️! He's warning that the rollercoaster-like power demands of AI data centers could totally mess with the stability of the global electricity supply! ⚡️ He's seriously urging governments to quickly step in and curb these fluctuations. 📈 The International Energy Agency also predicts that data center power consumption will double by 2030! To tackle the transformer shortage and keep the grid stable, Hitachi Energy plans to pour $6 billion into boosting production and hire 15,000 new employees. Talk about a massive undertaking! 😮‍💨

2.  Guizang (guizang.ai) shared a super cool new feature from **Dia Browser**: **History Summary**! 💡 Users can regularly have AI analyze their browsing data from the past week, and it can even "lay bare" all those videos you secretly watched 😲. This totally shows how AI's application in personal data analysis is getting deeper and more personalized. It feels like AI is really starting to get us! 🕵️‍♀️📚 ['More details'](https://x.com/op7418/status/1940997705779892617)

3.  Wwwgoubuli shared an **innovative way to collaborate deeply with AI**—he no longer directly asks AI for answers. Instead, he first gets AI to help him sort out and refine his questions that might be unclear or poorly articulated. 🤔 This "letting AI organize the questions" method not only provides better context for subsequent real answers, but what's even cooler is that users can often find the answers to their own puzzles during the process of sorting them out. How clever is that?! ✨🤯 ['More details'](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1940974712055910818)

4.  Tom Huang envisions an exciting future for **Refly AI Creative Canvas**! 🎨 He imagines that if it could integrate **multi-modal generation capabilities** (like creating images, videos, and audio) 🎵, combined with multi-modal understanding models like **Gemini**, it would massively enrich content creation and help build even more captivating stories! 🎬 This definitely signals the huge potential for AI creative tools in multi-modal integration. The future looks bright! 🌟 ['More details'](https://x.com/tuturetom/status/1940943363898834947)

5.  @wwwgoubuli sharply voiced his dissatisfaction with some "gurus" in the current AI code field who are spouting off nonsense, in response to Wang Shuyi's question. 👨‍💻 He believes that **senior programmers** who genuinely use **AI programming** extensively wouldn't even come to similar conclusions, let alone bother to comment on them. His words highlight the extreme importance of **practical experience** in understanding AI-assisted programming—seriously hitting home for a lot of programmers! 💬🤔 ['More details'](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1940942626473365908)

6.  Baoyu shared **Andrew Ng's** "golden tip" on how to efficiently develop **MVPs** using **AI**! 💡 He pointed out that when time is tight, you should absolutely **drastically cut down the project scope** until it can be completed quickly. This way, you can kick off projects fast, validate ideas, and get feedback right away. 🚀 Ng vividly illustrated, using his own experience developing a **virtual audience simulator**, how this "**quick start**" approach helps developers beat procrastination, rapidly master new skills, and speed up product iterations—it's basically a godsend for entrepreneurs! 🏃‍♀️ ['More details'](https://x.com/dotey/status/1940868768948760613)

7.  In response to dontbesilent's advice to "just ask **AI** if you don't know," Baoyu hit the nail on the head regarding the "pain point" many find hard to practice—which is **not knowing how to clearly describe the problem**! 🤔 He stressed that when interacting with AI, "asking questions" is often more challenging than "answering questions," deeply revealing the critical importance of **questioning ability** in effective **AI interaction**. 💡 Looks like if we want AI to really help us out, we first need to learn how to ask the right questions! 💬 ['More details'](https://x.com/dotey/status/1940845834373157125)
