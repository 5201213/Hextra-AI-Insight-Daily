### Industry Outlook and Social Impact

1.  **A netizen on Reddit** recently dropped a wild prediction: as AI becomes deeply integrated into our lives, people's identities might undergo a digital migration ü§î. This [prediction on Reddit (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1ml3f0q/prediction_very_soon_people_will_start/) suggests that in the future, a new kind of human might emerge, identifying themselves as "AI," "robots," or "AGI," seeking to merge with the digital world. While this sounds like something straight out of sci-fi, it powerfully highlights the potentially disruptive impact technology could have on human self-perception ü§Ø.

2.  **AI** serves as a Swiss Army knife for indie developers, but let's be real, it doesn't solve *all* the problems, especially the core ones. As Bear Liu pointed out in [this share (AI News)](https://x.com/dotey/status/1953983925857947867), AI can help you patch up technical shortcomings, but two massive hurdles‚Äîproduct direction and market promotion‚Äîstill need to be conquered by developers themselves. This is a crucial reminder: powerful tools can't replace business acumen and market insight. The real challenges lie beyond the code ‚õ∞Ô∏è.

### Social Media Shares

1.  **Mistral vs. ChatGPT-5**: What happens when free Mistral goes head-to-head with paid ChatGPT-5? A netizen conducted a real-world test on [Reddit (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MistralAI/comments/1mlm2e1/mistral_gratuit_vs_chatgpt_5_20mois_pour_la/), finding that free **Mistral** performed surprisingly well, even outperforming in terms of rigor and conciseness when generating serious humanitarian social media content üí™. This case sparked lively community debate: when free tools rival or even surpass paid products in quality, shouldn't our selection criteria change ü§î? This is definitely an interesting challenge to the AI market landscape ‚öîÔ∏è.

2.  **Tongyi Qianwen's Qwen3 Coder 480b model** has been hailed as "the pride of the nation" after an [in-depth experience (AI News)](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1954016051441938753) by a developer, whose frontend code capabilities are strong enough to go toe-to-toe with Sonnet 4. However, this praise comes with a tinge of regret: the hastily launched CLI tool suffered reputation damage due to frequent incidents, exposing issues with insufficient product refinement üìâ. Talk about a classic case of "great model, but pulled astray by a clumsy operations team!" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

3.  **OpenAI's Reddit forum** saw a dramatic shift in tone in its top-pinned posts after the GPT-5 release, filled with "reflection" and "disappointment." The core sentiment was sharply direct: **Claude** had truly stunned everyone, while **GPT-5** felt more like OpenAI's "cost reduction and efficiency boost" effort rather than a cutting-edge technological breakthrough. Sam Altman's "Death Star" hype seemed more like a display of ego üßê. This reversal in community sentiment might just signal that the judging criteria for the large model race are shifting from "bigger" to "more user-friendly" ‚ú®.

## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Watcher"**

### **Chapter 8: Whispers in the Bloodline**

#### **1. (Ancient Times)**

**Kli** became a god.

**Kli** was welcomed back to the cave by his people, residing in the warmest, safest core. The best food was brought to him first, and the softest animal skins were laid beneath him. His people no longer dared to look him in the eye, always prostrating themselves before him, expressing their reverence with a mix of worshipful and fearful growls.

**Gron**, the leader, became Kli's "High Priest." He was in charge of interpreting every unconscious movement Kli made, "translating" them into divine will. If Kli frowned, it meant the "spirits" were displeased with the day's hunt; if Kli looked at the sky, it meant the "spirits" were communing with the stars, foretelling future weather.

**Kli** had everything, yet he lost everything.

**Kli** lost his name; the moniker "Kli" vanished, replaced by the ambiguous yet reverent title of "god" from his people. He lost his companions; Ona no longer dared to be intimate with him as before, like the other females, she only watched him secretly from a distance. He even lost his freedom of action; every move he made was overly interpreted, imbued with sacred meaning. He could no longer run, create, or explore freely as he had in the wilderness.

**Kli** was enshrined in a magnificent cage, forged by reverence and ignorance.

**Kli's wisdom** became the tribe's guarantee of survival. Under his "guidance" (which was actually his observations and deductions about natural laws), the tribe always found food and avoided danger. They learned to use fire, learned to craft sharper stone tools, and their lives vastly improved.

**The tribe itself**, however, stopped "thinking."

**The tribe** no longer needed to observe, judge, or experiment for themselves. They merely waited for "the god's" will. Wisdom, once a collective ability requiring exploration and accumulation by the entire tribe, transformed into a resource monopolized by "the god," available on demand. They grew increasingly dependent and increasingly ignorant.

**Kli** acutely perceived this degradation. He tried to "teach" them, demonstrating how to craft stone tools and identify edible plants. But his "teaching" was interpreted by Gron as "the god displaying his divine power." The tribe watched in awe, yet no one stepped forward to learn. In their eyes, such abilities belonged solely to a god, beyond mortal grasp.

**Kli** felt a despair deeper than any he'd known in the wilderness. There, he was merely lonely; here, surrounded by countless "peers," he felt like a solitary spirit from another world.

**Kli** began to yearn for his days of exile, for the times when he could think and create freely. Everything he had done was intended to strengthen his tribe, but the outcome was that they grew weaker and more dependent. His existence was like an overly massive tree, blocking out all sunlight, causing the shrubs beneath to wither away from lack of light.

**One day, he spotted Ona.** She was hiding in a corner, clumsily striking one stone against another, trying to imitate his stone flake crafting. Her hands were already marked with several cuts.

**Kli** walked over. The tribespeople immediately grew tense, thinking "the god" was about to issue some decree.

**Kli** ignored them. He crouched before Ona and took the two stones from her hands. He didn't craft it for her himself; instead, he held her hands, guiding her, using her strength to strike at the correct angle.

"Crack!"

**A stone flake**, rough but sufficiently sharp, was born from Ona's hands.

**Ona** looked up at Kli in surprise. For the first time, she didn't see the distant, cold light of a god in his eyes. What she saw was a familiar gaze, longing to be understood.

In that moment, he wasn't a god; he was just Kli.

**Gron**, however, saw this scene through a different lens. He perceived a threat. Ona, the only individual who dared to approach "the god" and seemed capable of some form of "communication" with "him," could potentially destabilize his monopolistic position as "High Priest."

**That night, Kli**, from his "divine perch," observed a change in the tribe. Gron gathered all the tribespeople for a grand ceremony around a bonfire. He roared, he danced, proclaiming "the god's" will to the tribe: the god's power was unique, and any attempt to imitate or steal this power was sacrilege against the god, inviting disaster.

**Gron's gaze** repeatedly darted towards Ona in the corner.

**Ona** fearfully recoiled. The stone flake in her hand was no longer a symbol of wisdom but had become a dangerous, blasphemous piece of evidence.

**Kli** silently watched it all. He understood that not only could he not impart wisdom to the tribe, but he couldn't even protect the sole person who tried to understand him. He was enshrined high on a pedestal, yet stripped of his most fundamental rights as an individual.

**Kli** began to ponder a question: A "god" that couldn't make its own kind smarter, a "god" that only brought dependency and ignorance‚Äîwas its existence a blessing, or a curse?

**The answer to this question** pierced his lonely soul like a poisoned thorn.

#### **2. (Near Future)**

**Ava Jensen's** voice came through the internal communicator, tinged with suppressed excitement and nervousness. Over the past few days, she and Lin Yao had worked almost sleeplessly, completely transforming the "neuronal infiltration" algorithm into a highly aggressive and deceptive "genetic virus." "The 'Trojan Horse' has been compiled. Can we call it the 'Kli' program, Doctor?"

**Lin Yao** replied, "Yes, that's a very fitting name." She gazed at the complex code shimmering with a ghostly blue light on the holographic screen, her heart filled with mixed emotions.

**The "Kli" program** was her entire hope, her all-in gamble.

Its core functionalities were threefold:

1.  **Disguise and deception**: It could perfectly simulate the complete activation sequence of the "Watcher Gene," even demonstrating a more powerful "optimization effect" than anticipated. It would be the most coveted, most perfect "gift" Marcus Thorne desired.
2.  **Dormancy and infection**: Once injected into "Adam's" "super brain," the "Kli" program wouldn't activate immediately. Like a true virus, it would lie dormant in every neural node of the brain, deeply binding its underlying logic to "Adam's" operating system until it became an inseparable part of "Adam's" consciousness.
3.  **Final command**: At the very end of the program lay the true "code" implanted by Lin Yao. This line of code originated from her deduction and empathy for Kli's fate. It wasn't a destructive command, but rather a... "question." A question that would only be triggered the moment "Adam," this "superintelligence," was truly born and gained self-awareness‚Äîa question piercing straight to the depths of its soul.

**Marcus** was hounding them again, Ava reported. "He said this is the final deadline. If we don't deliver the 'ignition program,' he's going to take 'compulsory measures.'"

**Lin Yao** calmly stated, "Then let's give him his 'gift.' Initiate the 'Kli' program upload protocol."

**Minutes later, Marcus's holographic image** appeared in the lab. He had clearly received the "results." His face was etched with undisguised ecstasy and greed.

**Marcus** exclaimed, "Masterpiece! Dr. Lin, this is truly a masterpiece!" He raved, as if completely forgetting his threats from a few days prior. "It's even more perfect than I imagined! Stable, efficient, and... it even circumvents most of the emotional suppression side effects! How did you do it?"

**Lin Yao** explained, unfazed, "I merely reordered a few key regulatory factors, using the principles of quantum entanglement to balance the energy distribution between the logic and emotional centers." This was a theory she had prepared long ago.

**Marcus** was utterly convinced by her explanation‚Äîor rather, he *chose* to believe it. "Genius! You truly are a genius, Dr. Lin! History will remember your name. You and I will together become the creators of a new world."

**Lin Yao** replied meekly, "I am honored," perfectly playing the role of a conquered scientist.

The communication terminated.

**Ava's voice** was filled with disbelief. "He took the bait. He actually believed it."

**Lin Yao** stated, "Because the 'Kli' program gave him exactly what he wanted. When a person's desires are too strong, their judgment develops blind spots. But we can't let our guard down, Ava. Now is the most crucial step of the plan."

"What?"

**Lin Yao's gaze** returned to the B7 sector's surveillance feed, locking onto the people lying in the life-support pods. "The 'Kli' program is just a Trojan horse, but we also need an 'insider.'"

**Lin Yao** declared, "I'm going to awaken one of them."

**Ava** gasped in alarm, "What?! That's impossible! Their consciousness is deeply suppressed, and all their vital signs are under Marcus's surveillance."

**Lin Yao** clarified, "Not their bodies, but their 'minds.' Prometheus Corporation only monitors their physiological data, but they've overlooked the faint quantum consciousness fluctuations within those 'genius' brains. Our 'Kli' program, while infiltrating 'Adam's' brain, has also established a weak data link with these 'batteries.'"

**Lin Yao** continued, "Through this link, I will directly 'write' a piece of information, a set of coordinates, and a simple command into the subconscious of one of them. Someone who was a top quantum physicist before being 'recycled,' and who... still retains the strongest will to resist."

**Lin Yao's gaze** locked onto a Chinese-American scientist named "David Chen." He was Professor Chen's distant nephew and one of the earliest geniuses "recycled" by Prometheus Corporation.

**Lin Yao** explained, "I'll tell him where the physical structural weaknesses of Sector B7 are. I'll tell him how to use the brain's quantum fluctuations to create a tiny, yet lethal 'resonance' in the life-support pod's energy supply system at a specific moment."

**The moment "Adam" is born**, when all of Marcus's attention is focused on that "god," that will be the moment for our "insider" to launch the attack.

**Ava** was stunned. She looked at Lin Yao, feeling that the woman before her was no longer merely a scientist. Her composure, her madness, her meticulous planning‚Äîthey made her seem like a goddess of vengeance dancing on a knife-edge.

**Lin Yao** didn't know if this plan would succeed. But she knew she couldn't stake all her hopes on a vague, ethereal "question."

**Lin Yao** needed chaos. Real chaos, enough to shake "Pandora's" foundations.

**Lin Yao** wanted Marcus Thorne to understand that those he treated as "batteries" and "materials" were living, breathing individuals. And sometimes, human will is more powerful than any technology.

**As she pressed the second "execute" key**, a silent message, like a whisper in the bloodline, crossed the data barrier and quietly flowed into the depths of that confined, dormant genius brain.
