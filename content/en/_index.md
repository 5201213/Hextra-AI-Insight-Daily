3.  While "996" (9 AM to 9 PM, 6 days a week) is becoming a thing of the past, **Greptile**, a rising star in AI code review, has boldly proclaimed a "007" (24/7) ethos, demanding "no work-life balance" from its employees. What's mind-boggling is that this extreme "wolf culture" hasn't scared off investors; instead, it's successfully attracted the favor of **top-tier VC firm Benchmark**, reportedly closing a whopping **$30 million** Series A funding round, skyrocketing the company's valuation to $180 million. üí∞ This startup, founded by a mere 22-year-old graduate and incubated by YC, claims its AI robot can review code with the precision of the most seasoned colleague. However, surrounded by formidable rivals like Graphite and Coderabbit, is this "no effort, no gain" extreme overtime culture truly the catalyst for its success, or a hidden pitfall for a future crash? ü§î The market is keenly watching.

4.  E-commerce giant JD.com has finally revealed its ace to the open-source community, officially launching a production-ready, end-to-end general-purpose **multi-agent system**, [JoyAgent-JDGenie - AI News](https://github.com/jd-opensource/joyagent-jdgenie), declaring "the gods have returned!" ‚öîÔ∏è This system is no mere lab toy; it absolutely crushed the competition in the **GAIA benchmark test**, dubbed the "AI College Entrance Exam," with an astounding 75.15% accuracy rate, showcasing its extraordinary ability to handle complex real-world tasks.

### **AI Frontier Research**

1.  Traditional AI training methods often swing between two extremes: either shackling models with rules from the start, limiting their creativity, or letting them "freely explore," which can lead them astray or even "learn bad habits." Meituan researchers bravely said "no" to this and proposed a brand-new framework called [Metis-RISE](https://github.com/MM-Thinking/Metis-RISE), cleverly employing a new "free-range then domesticated" training strategy. üêë They first use **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** as an incentive, like free-ranging, to encourage models to boldly explore various possibilities, fully unleashing their potential. Subsequently, they use **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** for targeted "tutoring," consolidating strengths and correcting errors, meticulously refining the model as if domesticated. üéì This unconventional training combo delivers astonishing results: their 72B parameter model shot straight to fourth place on the authoritative OpenCompass **multimodal reasoning** leaderboard, even surpassing some well-known commercial closed-source models. You can dive into the detailed technical specifics in [the Paper - AI News](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13056).
    ![AI News: Metis-RISE Framework Diagram](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0pwa8dtfc9s013735a6rh3z.avif)<br/><br/>![AI News: Model Performance Comparison](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0pwabg1fqsb33n9mzxnhm85.avif)<br/>

2.  Faced with a high-resolution, information-packed image, AI often gets lost like a headless chicken, overwhelmed by massive irrelevant details and unable to find the focal point. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è To tackle this tricky pain point, researchers from Fudan University and Nanyang Technological University teamed up to propose the **MGPO** framework. It successfully taught **Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)** a killer skill: **Visual Grounding**. This is like giving AI "fiery golden eyes"; before answering a question, the model can first predict the key region in the image based on the question, then "zoom in" to examine those details like a human, finally providing a precise answer. üéØ What's even more magical is that this powerful capability "emerged" through **reinforcement learning** self-play, requiring absolutely no expensive manual annotation data‚Äîit can self-evolve and iterate based solely on the correctness of the final answer. This groundbreaking research has been published in [Paper - AI News](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05920) and generously [open-sourced the Code - AI News](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/MGPO).
    ![AI News: Model Attention Heatmap](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0pwad9hfvxrtk1y9tn22rja.avif)<br/>

3.  **Spatial Transcriptomics** data is like a microscopic map embedded with life's code, but its low resolution and high noise often make it challenging for scientists to decipher. Now, a research team from Tokyo University and McGill University has developed the **SUICA** model, which acts like a highly skilled "data alchemist." üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This model innovatively combines **Graph Autoencoder** and **Implicit Neural Representation (INR)** technologies to denoise, enhance, and super-resolve this high-dimensional, sparse biological data, truly turning "waste into treasure." Data processed by SUICA not only boasts higher visual quality but also contains stronger biological signals, revealing fine tissue structures and cell states previously unobservable. üß¨ This research, accepted into top-tier conference ICML 2025, provides a stronger data foundation for AI-assisted pathological diagnosis and drug development. Its [Paper - AI News](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=XWC7JXHXvo) and [Open-Source Project - AI News](https://github.com/Szym29/SUICA) are both online for global researchers to use.
    ![AI News: SUICA Processing Effect](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/07/news_01k0pwaf8jen2vsqj9mbb45cd9.avif)<br/>

### **AI Industry Outlook & Social Impact**

1.  In 2025, the open-source **large model** arena is witnessing an absolutely spectacular "clash of the titans," and the **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture is undoubtedly the brightest star of the show. üëë From **DeepSeek-V3**'s ultimate 9-expert design to **Qwen3**'s decisive innovation of abandoning shared experts, and the rumored trillion-parameter "behemoth" size of **Kimi-K2**, all major top vendors are furiously "racing" on this golden MoE track. Meanwhile, small and medium-sized models, represented by **SmolLM3-3B**, are challenging the dominance of the "big guys" with astounding efficiency and performance, thanks to ingenious architectural optimizations and massive data pre-training. This tech wave not only signals the graceful exit of traditional dense models from the historical stage but also brings developers the "happy dilemma" of balancing ultimate performance with controllable costs. This is undoubtedly one of the most thrilling chapters in current **AI News**.

2.  "Apple" is indeed still the master of making money, but under the AI wave, its "AI flavor" seems a bit lacking. üçé **Apple**'s "slow pace" in the field of artificial intelligence is gradually eroding Wall Street's patience, with some prominent analysts even openly discussing CEO **Tim Cook**'s tenure. While Cook, with his unparalleled operational excellence, steadily pushed Apple's market value to an epic peak of $3.1 trillion, the lackluster AI presentation at last month's **WWDC** Global Developers Conference, especially the delay of the highly anticipated major Siri overhaul, exacerbated external disappointment. ‚è≥ Critics argue that the AI era calls for bold product visionaries like Steve Jobs, rather than just operation masters skilled in calculations. This legendary helmsman, who once led Apple through a "golden decade," now faces a severe test: whether he can usher in the next AI chapter.
