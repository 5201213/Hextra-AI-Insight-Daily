## 3. Paid Subscription Services

- All payments go through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, this Site doesn't stash your payment info.
- Subscriptions will auto-renew unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- Refunds? Nah, not generally given after payment, unless the law says so or a specific promo states otherwise. 🤷‍♀️
